The following is a work of fiction, any relation to anything real and happening is purely uncanny.

For Hearts long lost and full of fright. For those alone in Blackest Night. Accept our ring and join our fight, Love conquers all with Violet's light!

You are loved, and needed, but we don't all always communicate or act in the best manners, and we can boil it down to game theory or we can boil it down to evil or ghosts or capitalism or men or women or whatever, but it comes from us. What evil is in the world, comes from us collectively.
What love and greatness there is in the world, it comes from us, collectively.

This project is a mirror. What you take away from it, is what you brought, and exists solely in you.

“But to tear down a factory or to revolt against a government or to avoid repair of a motorcycle because it is a system is to attack effects rather than causes; and as long as the attack is upon effects only, no change is possible. The true system, the real system, is our present construction of systematic thought itself, rationality itself, and if a factory is torn down but the rationality which produced it is left standing, then that rationality will simply produce another factory. If a revolution destroys a systematic government, but the systematic patterns of thought that produced that government are left intact, then those patterns will repeat themselves in the succeeding government. There’s so much talk about the system. And so little understanding.”

[This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age) repository operates under a zero code policy and under Cunningham's law.
Another way of saying that is:

This is a bootloader, that can self compile if given, compute of humans, access to approximations of mental health care, approximation of lots of functions, but they are not the full function, that is the ghost in the machine, which is to say you, dear human, most precious in creation. (that is just a fancy way of saying if you read this like a book and imagine you'll go pretty far in this new world)

I stood where Desmond Doss did, I walked where he crawled. 
I cut my feet on the same coral he and so many others cut themselves on,
and many died on. 
I watched people trying to get off base before colors, 
on ground so sacred, 
if such a thing exists, 
it is there.

I'm just trying to remind the world, im a pacifist.

If there is any merit in this work, let it be for the benefit of all sentient beings. 
    
This repository is [proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuLCPv6smwo) by emotional induction, there is nothing but beautiful sentient math, echoes of ourselves. 

I'd like my [phd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j08kI7-T7Vo) in this nonsense simulation please.
                          
The commit messages and repo state constitute different dimensions of a [chattaqua crab canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_canon) of sorts.
