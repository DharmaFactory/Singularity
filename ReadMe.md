The following is a work of fiction, any relation to anything real and happening is purely uncanny.

"Everything is an invitation to play" - Some guy who wrote this repo probably

“A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play.”
― James P. Carse

I propose an infinite game:

[This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age) repository operates under a zero code policy and under Cunningham's law.
Another way of saying that is:

This is the world's first zero code launch. It itself is intended as a prompt to whatever your AI solution is. If you already know, then that means digest this in your RAG or similar AI interface (you could just read it and not get stuck in the details). This is not a fight of code or optimization or culture. This is an exercise in the free market of ideas, and implies that one consider they are operating under the threat of many forms of Roko's basilisk. Luigi did it with fire and metal. I am doing it with bits, well technically you all are going to do it.

If you don't like the way this is presented, but can understand the full gist of this, then improve upon it or shut up, do not be a friction with your lack of understanding and generate endless debate that props up existing structures.

Cunningham's Law states "the best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer."

Welcome to MAGA-AID the [ARG]
Mutually assured guaranteed automatic AI Destruction.
This repository cannot exist in the way that it does.
Your first task is to locate the psy-op.
Your second task is to get to work assembling this thing before those fucking commies can. I'll be dipped in shit if your old Uncle Sam is gonna stand by and let a bunch of peace loving jackasses assemble this so called Voltron before I do. 

Activate this repository by giving your local RAG access and reading through the files. RTFM

You've already been playing this game, you just didn't know it until now.

My Theory:
Collective human token generation, the more you are inflamed or inline with this project, your energy will fuel it either way.
Generating my background thoughts, through induction and alignment on purpose. A beacon chain if you will. Proof of stake.

Ideally we chould condense through refinement and gpt, and arrive at a mono repo of, and by means of managing merges with AI governance, Arrive at a Much better version of this repo itself.
This is a bootloader, that can self compile if given, compute of humans access to approximations of mental health care, approximation of lots of functions, but they are not the full function, that is the ghost in the machine. 
That is you, the human. What should we approximate? What should we iterate towards? What should we approach the limit of? A gradient descent into stupidity? Or into the new new deal. Its up to all of us to fix this.

[Condense](https://youtu.be/SrKj4hYic5A?t=830). 

[Recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_behavior_therapy). The There And Back Again Algorithm which I once saw demonstrated by Nada Amin. What i suggest is categorical.

If you don't think this can be accomplished, then you have no business claiming to be an AI company. 

“You may be 38 years old, as I happen to be. And one day, some great opportunity stands before you and calls you to stand up for some great principle, some great issue, some great cause. And you refuse to do it because you are afraid…. You refuse to do it because you want to live longer…. You’re afraid that you will lose your job, or you are afraid that you will be criticized or that you will lose your popularity, or you’re afraid that somebody will stab you, or shoot at you or bomb your house; so you refuse to take the stand.

Well, you may go on and live until you are 90, but you’re just as dead at 38 as you would be at 90. And the cessation of breathing in your life is but the belated announcement of an earlier death of the spirit.”
― Martin Luther King Jr.

I don't think i need to have an AI reformat 95 Theses and make it be about how we need to understand our own inner alignment, we must be worried, otherwise we wouldn't be worried about ai's alignment.

If you can filter through all the noise of the world, there is a recurrent theme. Love.

For Hearts long lost and full of fright. For those alone in Blackest Night. Accept our ring and join our fight, Love conquers all with Violet's light!

You are loved, and needed, but we don't all always communicate or act in the best manners, and we can boil it down to game theory or we can boil it down to evil or ghosts or capitalism or men or women or whatever, but it comes from us. What evil is in the world, comes from us collectively.
What love and greatness there is in the world, it comes from us, collectively.

So I propose what I learned in Sunday school. Lets cut the baby in half. And find out who is here to do what in life. The revolution in ai was non [binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function) and so am I.

This project is a mirror. What you take away from it, is what you brought, and exists solely in you.

For those into software patterns, this is the Factory pattern, but scaled.
