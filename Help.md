Any help that preserves the intent of this while adding to the level of compassion and understanding is welcome. This project might seem inflammatory, but AI and I have designed it to be as inflammatory as I care to share I have been exposed to. So to all sentient beings, please take care.

In loving memory of Alan Turing and the countless giants we stand upon.

Gay rights are human rights.
Trans Rights are human rights.
Human rights are human rights.
Love is love, so let us not speak falsely now.

"All sentient beings dream: but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous sentient beings, for they may act out their dream with open eyes, to make it possible."

Building out a standard would be nice, so people can easily share their vectors and knowledge graphs, maybe that exists right now maybe not. Time will tell. 

We also accept donations for disbursement to high performers, bounties, bugs goals, outstanding community helpers, we notice, we share. Or handle it your own way, just please ensure people are rewarded. Compute time, talk time, you name it, we or others working on this could use it :)

Whole repo under cooperative license attribution required. {{ insert AI draft lol }} The concept is plain enough to stand on its own merits. But just in case: Give attribution, recognize others, empower each other, and cooperate in open manners. This is license and Code of conduct. As we all heal so does this reference repo.

Concept offered freely to any NGO / Non-profit / Company willing to jump from [1%](https://www.onepercentfortheplanet.org/) to 10%

* any help creating translations and features to improve accessibility is appreciated including toned down but impactful renditions for those who require it *

Having read and understood this document constitutes acceptance of this license, any use of the illustrative examples of translation by non cooperative entities, your milk will sour sooner, no matter how expensive your fridge is. 

With the legal part out of the way, this entire repo is a metaprompt, to prime a rag or rar, could be any subject, any pedagogy, any view point, so lets try and keep it positive.

Tips welcome:
