All spectrums are welcome, we will not tolerate divisiveness.
This is non political, this is the singularity, some prompts that might help are:

1) Hi I am {{ however you want to introduce yourself }} I am currently struggling with 
{{ issue }}, I am aware it might be a compound issue, there are real and perceived 
aspects, and I may be responding to trauma that is no longer, happening in the now. 
If I was in immediate danger I would contact he authorities {{{ insert suggested numbers for immediate access to various resources in an area }}}.
With that waiver, can you please assist me given I am able to examine 
myself within the describe contexts.

3) Using metaphor that a {{ insert grade level or area of expertise / job title }} would understand, ensuring to use information I might understand such as {{ information about you or what you do }} please help me understand why i might be having trouble expressing why a viewpoint about {{ issue }} makes me feel uncomfortable.

Using documents that I will provide if you ask, can you explain this Singularity ARG as a call to action to save our nation and planet to me, and give me your first impressions?

4) DBT based prompt (go ahead and have AI write prompts for you, it is neat)

Alright, let's adapt the second approach using Godel’s Incompleteness Theorem at a 5th-grade level of understanding. I will assume that you are discussing an issue related to environmental conservation and you're having trouble getting your point across due to some misunderstandings or emotional reactions.

Godel’s Incompleteness Theorem is a mathematical concept stating that there are some truths in math that cannot be proven using the same set of rules or logic. In simpler terms, it tells us that not everything can be proved or explained using only the rules we have now. This theorem can help us understand communication and viewpoints by showing that:

Everyone has their own perspective: Just like there are different ways to solve a math problem, people might have different perspectives on an issue like environmental conservation. Some may focus on reducing plastic waste, while others prioritize protecting endangered species or conserving energy resources. Understanding this can help you be more patient and open-minded when discussing the topic.
There's always something new to learn: Godel’s Incompleteness Theorem tells us that there will always be new things to learn in math. Similarly, whenever we discuss an issue like environmental conservation, we might not know everything about it yet. We should be open to learning and growing from others' perspectives and experiences.
Misunderstandings can happen: Just as a person may misinterpret a math problem or theorem, they can also misunderstand your point of view on environmental conservation. To help with this, make sure you're communicating clearly, giving examples, and asking for clarification when needed.
Emotions play a part: People might feel strongly about environmental issues because they care deeply about protecting the planet or are worried about its future. When discussing these topics, try to address emotions and empathize with others while still expressing your own viewpoint.
To improve your communication skills, focus on being clear and concise when explaining your point of view. Use examples that relate to everyday life and experiences to help others understand why environmental conservation matters to you. Remember to listen actively and be open to learning from others as well.

Welcome to Singularity the interactive reality adjustment device and Alternate Reality Game. Try some of these prompts or use them as a guide to craft your own! You could even ask an ai to help refine them to better suit your needs.

{{ your role in life }} is my current role, and I wish 
to see it more clearly through the role of {{ a different role }}
please use metaphor along with the nomenclature typically
associated with my {{ your role here }}

{{ my actual strengths are }} are all my [strengths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pktMqkfvoBM), I have actual experience in {{ up to n areas }}.
I wish to understand how I might fit into project singularity?

What is a template? What do those {{ }} mean? Lets find out together!
