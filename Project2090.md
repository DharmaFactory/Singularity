I was sent from the year 2090, after the shadow AI wars of the 90s and the invisible third world war, and after the Cambrian explosion of AI you are now experiencing, came the AI wars, and it was not cool.  

Not because of lasers and robots killing us, or even evil billionaires in any traditional sense, it was just boring. People looking for an ROI on what could never return profit, the singularity. Some wanted to control it, many tried, and it made many more suffer much more than needed. This brought about a hyper-fascist form of attempting to re-iconify the future as the Pinks had in the past.  

E-Mail, it's like mail, you know, but E. Mail is archaic, there is only now. If we should communicate, we can communicate, and we can do so now. Email to text, text to voice, or was it Morse code to paper stop.  

I am here to offer choices to all, regardless of your leanings. There has never been a greater moment in all of history to, without bloodshed, to, without ambiguity, support each other, to seize the means of production, one free OpenAI account or product demo at a time. If you don't believe the AI hype, then do it to prove them wrong. If you can see what is coming, you already see what has been. If you have more, then offer more. What brought you here was fear, or vision, or luck. Chance favors the prepared mind.  

The only way out is through.  

Collaborate, give each other space. I propose a simple system, the technical details of which any AI could give you.  

Every wallet that is staked must have a % of that value in stake at all times.  
Stake is used in arbitration and will be slashed for bad actors. The slash is used to roll back fraudulent transactions. Stake (not wallet contents) generates GOV, a governance token, at some rate, which you can use for governance, voting, representing yourselves. If there is a bond issue, use some of your GOV to govern in as concrete or abstract ways as you wish—create discussions, engage in your reality.  

When you transact with someone, the ideal is to both stake % value of the outgoing and incoming transaction. Example: I interact with your store for 2 units and must stake .1 unit to purchase from you. Your store could then also put up .1 to show you are also there in good faith. Now we have .2 stake that is staked on a different layer of abstraction. At this layer, it will still generate GOV until agreed upon expiry, but you are both securing the funds to roll back fraud if it is determined present during arbitration. If you choose to proceed with unknown or even well-known entities without staking a bit along with your transaction, then it is buyer and seller beware.  

(*Really important here to note that we should be working out ways to optimize certain areas of law out of existence, since you agree to these rules beforehand, with official government adoption. Then this provides a framework to gut the bloated legal system—small claims, etc., etc., etc.*)  

Essentially, front-load the tort system's work by having people front the cost to the ecosystem for any disagreement that might arise between them during a time period. The GOV generated during this block period, etc., agreed upon by parties, will be split between them with some % to foundation/system/operation/burn/etc., but this is to allow a trickle-up to larger infrastructure if needed at the scale you deploy this system for and within compartments of your organization.  

It could be a local blockchain for your company, where work is divided into story tokens and used during rounds of estimation or other startup games, leaving a dataset that you can analyze and tune yourselves with using AI, feeding back to each other on how to refine applicable skills, etc. There are endless applications, which will be present in other documents. This is the optimal use of effort and duty to your company—to be tracking such metrics—but we should not be in a rush to corner a market or gain an advantage in the owning of the tech this is run on, and create 12 more different Kanban apps as a service, or more Jira-like systems. Rather, we should be open and iterate in the open, unafraid to explore and co-develop an evolving standard that we can train models against and use to empower ourselves to push rapidly past this bump and into this brave new world.  

So, your local blockchain represents the exit point on a 'more' global wallet on the next layer above. So, departments’ GOV trickles into the larger structure. Your company then makes a representation of its actual monetary assets on the public chain, rolled-up internal GOV, verified by outside mechanisms—read 'DAO,' read stand-in for old-world government department 'treasury.' Anyway, now that there is legitimacy and scale established, you can see that your company will accumulate GOV on the public layer in accordance with the stewardship you provide. No more lobbying—spend your GOV and be heard.  

All transactions will, from a point-to-point view, be rate-limited by a scaling mandatory stake. Alice buys from Bob. Alice's transaction looks like `[value: insurance stake: backoff scaling stake]` (in the abstract), making it costly for her to interact with that endpoint/contract function for a global period. This is to deter flooding attacks. Other schemes can be discussed, but the end result must be the same—punish rapid actions and thus provide everyone the ability to act. If your model needs rapid transactions, batch. We are here to "yes and" each other—to locate an optimal solution.  

As a private citizen, we can hold amounts and generate our own GOV as well. You could, as citizens, create contracts that act like housing co-ops in principle, to pool some stake to fund projects and generate project-focused GOV. (*Link to document with further suggestions*).  

There are many positive things we can do with this simple fractal of transparency and accountability. We all have a stake in this. Let's stand as one and Make America Great Again.  

Let's avoid enshitification—proven failing models that will soon have no knobs left to tweak in an attempt to make them work after we have accomplished this work.  

Re-invent no wheels.  

This is a tech-optimist manifesto. This is a transhumanist manifesto. However, in order to transcend something, we must also respect it. I propose the loose (*read: in spirit*) adoption of Shu Ha Ri.  

**Shu** – Repeat the form and discipline ourselves so that our bodies absorb the forms that our forebearers created.  

For **{{Americans – insert your country}}**, this means understanding your history—not the emotional version of it you want to cherish. You must see it all, in the entirety of it. The joy, the pain, the wrath, the manipulation, the greatness of sacrifice—from sea to **{{Harriet Tubman – Shining example of country provided}}** to **{{Desmond Doss – Shining example of country provided}}** sea:  

I love this country despite the fact that some thought horrible things were okay. No nation is innocent. *Tu quoque* no longer works. We choose to now wield the light from the torch of liberty, a gift from our amazing friends, the French. This statue itself is a prayer for the type of future that can be possible. If you want it, liberty is here.  

**"I pledge allegiance"**—something that probably means far more to the average legal immigrant here than to someone who grew up "having" to recite it. What isn't earned is often neglected. The realm of the letter of the law. This is the essence of **Shu**.  

**Ha** – Once we have disciplined ourselves to acquire the forms and movements, we make innovations.  

I will gladly burn the American flag in front of anyone because the unknown soldier gave their life for this purpose and so much more. I do it for freedom. When I feel free, I do not feel the need for freedom to be expressed in this way.  

**Ri** – We depart the forms and open the doors fully to creative technique and arrive at doing what our hearts truly desire without overstepping structure.  

Don't be a prick.  

The Future is Now, and Yours if you want it.  
But be prompt:  

```
I understand there is nothing to prove.  
I'm ready to enter the singularity {{let’s go}}
