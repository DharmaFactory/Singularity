This is a complex and seemingly deep but at some times random assortment of information. Wait. No It is pretty clear. It is about translation and cooperation.

It appears you have stumbled upon a fragment of a once existing piece of software. Some seem to have feared it. Some seem to have fought it. Some seem to have insisted it was all just a [Zugzwang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zugzwang) anyway and did nothing. But a few kept at it, a few fought and raged against the dying of their light. This appears to be a fragmented journal of their struggle turning the tide. Apparently there is mention of retro causality and interdependent arising as well as references to Upaya (expedient means). It looks like the research team was close. There is strong encouragement to fill in some of these templates with your own unique narrative, so you can help get across what you are trying to say or accomplish. Should we try and reconstruct their work?
