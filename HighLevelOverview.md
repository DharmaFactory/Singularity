Contained here are the keys to the kingdom. 

1) Work and a structural pattern towards a general scheme (in the sense of plan not rug pull) to utilize crypto to a potential beyond png's. (could be a list of those implementing systems that are true to the intent of generating governance tokens by holding stake of some kind, even if just created inside of your company)
2) Tutorials on how to get open webui going, ollama, local rag (potential for [RAR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHUgONA-x3g))
3) Self help / self care prompts
4) Instructions on seizing the means of production and radically pushing past dystopia / or a message about how we are all learning to adapt and serve the customer finally, which is also us. We are all shareholders and stewards.
5) Rough schematics towards creating an executive layer with which you can lay off ceo's and anyone else who is not contributing in manners deemed needed
6) A list of great clones of this that are taking off
7) Knowledge on understanding AI tooling like cursor and cursor lens for local dev
8) Instructions to rapidly understand more and more about what is in this repository and how to respect existing communities while pushing forward faster than can be stopped
9) ... this to be updated etc 

This can easily be turned into a nice well thought out template that can be tailored to any age group or person, given a few details about them. This is offered as an example. This is left intact as a great many people will be coming from a great many places in their minds and life, and we owe it to them to be there, because we owe it to ourselves to show up for our selves at this point in history. 

This could have a wrapper, we should make this as easy as possible to be done as privately as possible for people, so when we receive their informed consent later to actually access what they allow by sharing it themselves, without annoying CTA's and default on, opt-out nonsense, we actually have information we can all feel good about. I'm sure a great many authors after 
taking this experience might offer up their works, fiction and non. Perhaps even giving chains of thought as they work through reference material like:

To mock a mockingbird

Or anything that is non surface level and interesting from their fields.

Trust the customer to be eventually consistent and able to learn new things.
Otherwise how can they trust you to be eventually consistent and able to learn things. Corporations are people start acting like human beings with compassion. 

imho
