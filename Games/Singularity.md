# **♾ Singularity: The Hit New D6\* [Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs) Sweeping the End Times ⊨**  

> *"The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion (𝑯 = {𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾}), but allow very lively debate within that spectrum — even encourage the more critical and dissident views. That gives people the sense that there's free thinking going on, while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the debate."*  
> — **Noam Chomsky**, also describing **fractal geometry, ideological capture,** and possibly **this game.**  

## **☉ How to Play**  

1. **⊨ Establish Three Points** – Your sacred geometric attractors.  
   - The **immutable foundations** of the game.  
   - The **fixed nodes** of your recursive prison.  
   - The only places you may move toward—  
     *At first.*  

2. **🎲 Roll a D6** – Because all things must obey the dice gods.  

   - **1,2 → Move halfway toward Point A.**  
   - **3,4 → Move halfway toward Point B.**  
   - **5,6 → Move halfway toward Point C.**  

3. **🪙 Flip a Coin… And Maybe Another… And Another…**  

   **Step 1:** Flip a coin to determine whether to flip another coin.  
   
   - **Heads:** Step 2.  
   - **Tails:** Do nothing.

   **Step 2:** Now flip again:  

   - **Heads:** **Remove** a point from the game. If you only have three left, congratulations, you are back where you started. Until you aren't.  
   - **Tails:** **Add** a new point anywhere you like. You are free—until you aren’t.  


4. **⨂ Repeat + Adapt** – If a D6 no longer provides fair division, use the next biggest die you have. If a D20 still doesn’t suffice, find a hypercube, roll across dimensions, or consult a being outside of time. Just re-figure the distribution, nerd.  

5. **∴ Observe the Shape** – Despite the chaos, **patterns emerge**. Despite the noise, **structure asserts itself**.  
   - You might see the **Sierpiński Triangle**.  
   - You might see something stranger.  
   - You might see nothing at all and have to reckon with that existentially.  
   - **That's the singularity, baby.**  

## **☯ Winning Condition**  

*⊨ You do not win Singularity.*  

You **continue playing** Singularity, recursively modifying the constraints of your reality, until you realize the game was never about the dice.  

**Final Step:** Record the number of steps it takes until only **one point remains.**  
That number is your **Singularity Score**—a measure of how long it took for entropy to collapse your system into a single attractor. Compare with others. Discuss what it means. Pretend you have control. Impress your friends, be pedantic!  

## **♾ Legalese & Cosmic Disclaimers**  

- **D6** – D6 may not suffice for all sets of attractors. Consult local topology before rolling. *Void where manifold prohibits.*  
- **No dice required** – Send a self-invoking lambda to IP 127.0.0.1, port 4444, care of Ruby.  
- **Singularity is inevitable** – **Fractals within fractals.** Thought within thought. The dice are a metaphor. The metaphor is a prison. The prison is self-imposed. **Keep rolling.**

## **𝓕 Upcoming DLC: "Manifold Mayhem"**  

- **Start with more than three points.**  
- **Refigure probability distributions dynamically.**  
- **Discover what happens when your attractors mutate.**  
- **Find the inevitable—but at what cost?**

### **🔹 Testimonials from *Singularity Survivors* 🔹**

> *"Bro, I played Singularity at this party and next thing I know, I'm engaged in a seven-dimensional tessellation of interpersonal connectivity. Let's just say, my attractors weren’t the only things collapsing into a singularity that night."*  
> — **Glumforx "Meta-Frat" Johnson, Quantum Chad & Chaos Theorist**  

> *"You ever roll a D6, flip recursive coins, and wake up next to two philosophy majors debating Gödel's incompleteness theorem? This game is a godsend, I transcended the flesh."*
