# Open Questions  

## ☉ A Declaration of Recursive Challenge  

What prompt, if given to a generative AI,  
would yield this repository—  
its **structure, intent, and efficacy**?  

A **self-modifying, self-reflecting system**,  
a **tree of thought**,  
an **algorithm unwinding its own creation** in commit history,  
while simultaneously constructing a **narrative of mystery, recursion, and hidden codes**?  

### **The Challenge**  

$20 if you can figure this out.  
It needn’t be exact, but it must:  
- Reflect the **architecture of thought** encoded here.  
- Edit **itself in place**, demonstrating self-revision.  
- Record **its growth as commits**, while  
- **Unwinding** an opposing thought **in reverse** within the commit messages.  
- **Weave nested, intricate structures** (*bonus: $25 if you can do it at scale*).  

**Unpaid Until Sponsored:**  

- How many characters were needed to create this?  
- Which character was written first?  
- Which character from *The Venture Brothers* inspired this project’s personality?  

### **The Singularity Trivia Game**  

Why race for AGI when it’s already here and gone?  
Why wage information warfare when you can play the mysteries of **Collatz**?  

Or you can just be a techbro.  

Not the techbro the people deserve,  
but the **techBro futureCorp needs**.
