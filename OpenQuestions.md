What prompt when given to genAI yields this repository and the so far unbranched structure?

$20 if you can figure this out. It needn't be exact, but it must follow structure, intent, and efficacy of this project and (ideally) tree of thought editing itself in place etc as is demonstrated in commit history, and recording it in commits, while also unwinding a thought in the opposite direction inside of the git commit messages and weaving a narrative containing mysteries and codes.

Do that and I will give you $20.

Bonus if you can make it weave nested intricate structures, so like $25 to you for that, on top of the other $20.
