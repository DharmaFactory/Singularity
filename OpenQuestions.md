What prompt when given to genAI yields this repository and the so far unbranched structure?

$20 if you can figure this out. It needn't be exact, but it must follow structure, intent, and efficacy of this project and (ideally) tree of thought editing itself in place etc as is demonstrated in commit history, and recording it in commits, while also unwinding a thought in the opposite direction inside of the git commit messages and weaving a narrative containing mysteries and codes.

Do that and I will give you $20.

Bonus if you can make it weave nested intricate structures, so like $25 to you for that, on top of the other $20.


Unpaid until sponsored:  
How many characters were needed to create this?  
Which Character was written first?  
Which character from "The Venture Brothers" inspired the personality behind this project?
These and countless more questions await those brave enough to play the singularity trivia game.

Why waste time racing for AGI, it's here and gone. Why build weapons of information warfare, when you can work the mysteries of collatz? 

Or you can go be a techbro.

Not the tech bro the people deserve, but the techBro futureCorp needs. 

the corporation is sacred
but we also play trivia games.

[Malachi 3:10-12 "Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, so that there may be food in my house, and thus put me to the test, says the Lord of hosts; see if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you an overflowing blessing. I will rebuke the locust for you, so that it will not destroy the produce of your soil; and your vine in the field shall not be barren, says the Lord of hosts. Then all nations will count you happy, for you will be a land of delight, says the Lord of hosts"](https://thegivingblock.com/)
