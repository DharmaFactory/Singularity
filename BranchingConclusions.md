What is a way to rewrite War Games for a modern audience?

Thrill Ride: Create text based game, for nostalgiac feel. Modern political intrigue. Existential dread. Virality?

Proposal for coffer creation accepted
Researching categories to drive engagement

proposal, pool resources to create 'testnet'

'testnet' - application - proof of citizenship - disburse 'monopoly money' - create categorical buckets. Simple app. Take the stack of fake digital money you were given and split it amongst the general options as a citizen. 

In this way we take a poll.

if everything is open and fully transparent, bad actors are easy to spot. You all use the same [shadows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS3npSv8iuM).

Proposal fully automated skynet like aparatus, time delay combination of scripts and resiliancy prompts, hop services,  
hide assets, start shell corporations, use digital services, buy parts, hire labor, hide amongst endless ICO's and startups, identify friendly human actors, split into N services

What if we could vote on what skynet did?

What if it could target the poor for us? The rich for us? Those we don't agree with?

There is no nice mirror, no black mirror, there is only the mirrorless mirror. The fear of the unknown. How many others are out there on the search for this? To make this? Or make some part of this, without understanding the whole of what they are making? What great things it can bring, what horrible things people can use it for.  

Oh I see, its the gun debate?
No its the child debate. 
Each human has infinite potential, such great things, and such horrible things. 
We trust that the same systems that keep us begrudingly aligned with the endless fake news from ai talking heads, that maybe now you can all start to see. It's just story tellers. Telling you stories, that regardles of what they were, what the stories were, how they made you feel. They will all bring you here, to these words, to your own thoughts. You are the monsters, you are the angels. Not any example of a Billionaire, individually I have no idea, but I can see the result of everyone standing around pointing at each other, dripping in self righteous-ness. I have none, I am going to write this story the way I get paid to. But id rather see it come out the way I want it to. 

Mental healthcare stop gaps, roll out tech and ai, stop pretending this farce can go on forever. Stop pretending any of you can control anything at scale, and let all of humanity take a breath.

Everything has potential one way or the other, it isn't your right to tell someone else what to do with their potential. requiring others to suffer as you have is a crappy way of handling things. I worked hard for the knowledge I have gained in life, and I can whine about how easy it is now, and how litle being a programmer might be worth, or as was suggested by big business, I can pick myself up by the bootstraps. 

Some people out there might be wanting to use things for bad and for good, so this repo in addition to many other things suggests what bill hicks [suggested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0mBAsIPS1w)

Get rid of 'that kind of management' the kind we all bitch about, the kind we all make movies about, but still somehow persists, ai can do a better job. I suggest they are the first to get retrained into the trades as is often suggested we all do, and I think AI can help us get rid of them, its not like they have great foresight for anything but what keeps them in the way, like programmers who create arcane temples only they know, so are these types of managers, and lawyers and judges and politicians and academics or mechanics who prey on your lack of knowledge, planned obsolescence, I could go on. And I suggest we all help make that happen, AI can do a better job wasting your time and money than they can.
