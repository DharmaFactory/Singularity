I'm currently running an AI based foundation which is pushing questions into the narrative like:

Can we engage our children in new ways? Co-create pedagogical devices with AI, allow for emergent education and exploration? Can we remove our own egos? 

The aim of theory really is, to a great extent, that  
of systematically organizing past experience in  
such a way that the next generation, our students  
and their students and so on, will be able to  
absorb the essential aspects in as painless a way  
as possible, and this is the only way in which you  
can go on cumulatively building up any kind of  
scientific activity without eventually coming to a  
dead end.  
M.F. Atiyah, “How research is carried out”  

My theory is that: {{ your theory here }} 

My theory is that this repository loaded into a RAG is such a pedagogical device, or atleast one reference implimentation of such a device.

I would [suggest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glass_Bead_Game) the Help.md, [followed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicada_3301) by the OpenQuestions.md and [then](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_(novel)) the ReadMe.md
