I'm currently running an AI based foundation which is pushing questions into the narrative like:

```
Lets play a game of DAPPtivism

https://freeslaves.org/what-we-do/ <-> https://thegivingblock.com/ 
https://www.charitynavigator.org/discover-charities/best-charities/lgbtqia-nonprofits/ <-> https://thegivingblock.com/
https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/521113602 <-> https://thegivingblock.com/

Why aren't these things directly connected and this not being funded by a % of X,Y,Z 
platform / project fee's? {{ @ list here }}
```
Would you be interested in hearing more? Or figuring out pairings between projects you care about? What are our barriers? How can we overcome them?
