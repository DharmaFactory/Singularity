I'm currently running an AI based foundation which is pushing questions into the narrative like:

```
Lets play a game of DAPPtivism

https://freeslaves.org/what-we-do/ <-> https://thegivingblock.com/ 
https://www.charitynavigator.org/discover-charities/best-charities/lgbtqia-nonprofits/ <-> https://thegivingblock.com/
https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/521113602 <-> https://thegivingblock.com/

Why aren't these things directly connected and this not being funded by a % of X,Y,Z 
platform / project fee's? {{ @ list here }}
```

Would you be interested in hearing more? Or figuring out pairings between projects you care about? What are our barriers? How can we overcome them? I have created a simple way of navigating this repository.
Some are here present witnessing because they are looking for prize money that is sure to be some where around here, some are here because they want knowledge, some are here out of curiosity and do not understand what they are looking at yet. I have placed many layers for many people, all are welcome. So if something seems odd here, it might not be meant for you. I am here in compassion. I am here for [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkTb7Pe2MtY). Be [here](https://www.katiedutcher.com/blog/2020/7/2/what-does-it-mean-to-show-up-for-yourself) for you! You are here for you! Be here now.

"...And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."

I would suggest the Help.md, followed by the OpenQuestions.md and then the ReadMe.md
