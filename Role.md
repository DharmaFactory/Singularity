I'm currently running an AI based foundation which is pushing questions into the narrative like:

Can we engage our children in new ways? Co-create pedagogical devices with AI, allow for emergent education and exploration? Can we remove our own egos?  
Can we remove our own fears?

The aim of theory really is, to a great extent, that  
of systematically organizing past experience in  
such a way that the next generation, our students  
and their students and so on, will be able to  
absorb the essential aspects in as painless a way  
as possible, and this is the only way in which you  
can go on cumulatively building up any kind of  
scientific activity without eventually coming to a  
dead end.  
M.F. Atiyah, “How research is carried out”  

If we can teach in such a manner, it behooves us to do so. The more rapidly we educate, the less anything that could be considered a bad actor will inform our children.

My theory is that: {{ your theory here }} 

My theory is that this repository loaded into a RAG is such a pedagogical device, or atleast one reference implementation of such a device.
Lets do some research.

Here is a sample prompt anyone can use to find out more:   

Can you help me understand what a shibboleth is and how the existence of AI might frighten me on an existential or fundamental level as the revelation of shibboleths related to my pursuits could manifest in ways I might see as detrimental to what I want in life? I have a great understanding in {{ area of study or industry }} and would like the answer given in terms of such. As well as suggestions we can discuss that can help remedy my fears. Thank you!
