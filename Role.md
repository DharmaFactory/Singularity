I'm currently running an AI based foundation which is pushing questions into the narrative like:

Can we engage our children in new ways? Co-create pedagogical devices with AI, allow for emergent education and exploration? Can we remove our own egos?  
Can we remove our own fears?

The aim of theory really is, to a great extent, that  
of systematically organizing past experience in  
such a way that the next generation, our students  
and their students and so on, will be able to  
absorb the essential aspects in as painless a way  
as possible, and this is the only way in which you  
can go on cumulatively building up any kind of  
scientific activity without eventually coming to a  
dead end.  
M.F. Atiyah, “How research is carried out”  

If we can teach in such a manner, it behooves us to do so. The more rapidly we educate, the less anything that could be considered a bad actor will inform our children.

My theory is that: {{ your theory here }} 

My theory is that this repository loaded into a RAG is such a pedagogical device, or atleast one reference implementation of such a device.
Lets do some research.

Here is a sample prompt anyone can use to find out more:   

Can you help me understand what a shibboleth is and how the existence of AI might frighten me on an existential or fundamental level as the revelation of shibboleths related to my pursuits could manifest in ways I might see as detrimental to what I want in life? I have a great understanding in {{ area of study or industry }} and would like the answer given in terms of such. As well as suggestions we can discuss that can help remedy my fears. Thank you!

I would [suggest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glass_Bead_Game) the Help.md, [followed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicada_3301) by the OpenQuestions.md and [then](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_(novel)) the [ReadMe.md](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmW3H-EXYS0)


“Around here, however, we don't look backwards for very long. We keep moving forward, opening up new doors and doing new things, because we're curious...and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.”
― Walt Disney Company

The answer to the puzzle isn't in the commit history, its in the commits and our commitment to the future.

Towards that of understanding and exploration, rather than paranoia and fear
