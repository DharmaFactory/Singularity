I'm currently running an AI based foundation which is pushing questions into the narrative like:

```
Lets play a game of DAPPtivism

https://freeslaves.org/what-we-do/ <-> https://thegivingblock.com/

platform / project fee's? {{ @ list here }}
```
Would you be interested in hearing more? Or figuring out pairings between projects you care about?
