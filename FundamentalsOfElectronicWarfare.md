One could easily go onto [ollama](https://ollama.com/), download an 8b 7b range abliterated coding model. Setup [cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) and [CursorLens](https://www.cursorlens.com/). Learn about [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/). 

From here an uncensored AI can explain and or your own experience can tell you what you (and very shortly your average person) can do now, giving how easy it is to lora a model with cline like tooling to reach out to AI.

Further steps could include generating a corpus of trivial and toy C programs and their (pick a specific target for now, like the window's executable) assembled output. 

Use this corpus to see if a model can predict what C will compile to. 

Alternatively go the other way and train a model than can reverse engineer given a binary representation. The possibilities are limitless here.

This is not to suggest being destructive but rather to progress our understanding of the nature of computing.

How I learned to stop worrying and love the singularity. The only reason we all aren't already hacked to a technological nothingness is by the good will of those who can.

Everything is [puzzling](https://www.puzzles.wiki/wiki/Puzzle_Solving_Resources) but that's ok, get a sip of tea enjoy the now. Puzzles might not de-stress you, or maybe these types of puzzles might not. 

Sometimes we all just want some answers.
