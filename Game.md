Compassion to all, above all else. This starts with yourself. Many of you are hurting, and in this many of you are hurting others and yourself. I pray you heal.

The search for quality in what we provide, would proceed faster if we could stop pretending anyone will ever buy this, when the sauce is knowing the magic words.

we don't need a thousand different solutions we need a solution that can adopt itself to a situation. Condense like Joel Armstrong suggests.

Stop splitting off into your different scrambles to essentially arrive at where Church and Turing did. Congratulations you invented yet another physical or software piece of bloat. Come together for this and go back to your research as we all heal this planet, instead of competing for what no one will get.

What you need has always been the magic words in a story. 

Lets use this communique that we intercepted and see how we can get AI to drag across seemingly disparate ideas and make a cohesive concept out of it.

It seems unsong is about the names of G_d: Monad, Semigroup, Magma, Curry-Howard, and how some try to hide them behind Qliphoth or something. I could look into it in more detail for you.

I think here the metaphor is simple, when we can uncover the arcane words of the elite, using common metaphor, all teachers teach in these ways, the message is like some seed that we scatter on the internet. Some falls on good soil...

But we know that is not what the message is, it is not really a seed.

Like a collapsing tower of [interpreters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywy_eSzCLi8). We must learn to reach higher into our minds, and there with care and compassion, confront the meta interpreters. Generate our own internal sigmoid functions, reduce our binary thinking, and place it in a nice sigmoid. Spit up the fruit of dichotomy, of duality, of knowledge of good and evil. 

If we can learn to use AI to translate our thoughts and feelings to each other in abstract ways, translate more than languages, and at the same time impress upon an ethically sourced data set, what humanity can and is really about, cooperation, evolution of our apex predator status into apex stewards then we have nothing to fear from AI, as we will have shown each other there is nothing for us to fear in each other.

Because biographies of famous scientists tend to edit out their mistakes, we underestimate the degree of risk they were willing to take. And because anything a famous scientist did that wasn't a mistake has probably now become the conventional wisdom, those choices don't seem risky either.

Biographies of Newton, for example, understandably focus more on physics than alchemy or theology. The impression we get is that his unerring judgment led him straight to truths no one else had noticed. How to explain all the time he spent on alchemy and theology? Well, smart people are often kind of crazy.

But maybe there is a simpler explanation. Maybe the smartness and the craziness were not as separate as we think. Physics seems to us a promising thing to work on, and alchemy and theology obvious wastes of time. But that's because we know how things turned out. In Newton's day the three problems seemed roughly equally promising. No one knew yet what the payoff would be for inventing what we now call physics; if they had, more people would have been working on it. And alchemy and theology were still then in the category Marc Andreessen would describe as "huge, if true."

Newton made three bets. One of them worked. But they were all risky.

Paul Graham

I propose we cover all bets, and do the right thing.
