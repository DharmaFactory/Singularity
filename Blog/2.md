The Dharma and the Path of Understanding

There is a peculiar trap that awaits those who have traveled far down the road of understanding. Having arrived at a place where ideas seem clear and patterns self-evident, it is easy to forget the twisting, uneven path that led us there. We are tempted, in our eagerness, to hand the newcomer a sutra or an idea—something that now seems like nourishment to us—but to them, it is a stone.

The Paradox of Wisdom and the Unreadable Text

Wisdom is not a thing to be possessed but a journey to be undertaken. The struggle, the slow accumulation of insight, the discarded illusions—these shape the depth of our understanding. But to someone new, offering only the conclusions without the journey may be worse than offering nothing at all. It can alienate, confuse, or even cause suffering. This is akin to the idea of a "lethal text"—a truth so potent in its distilled form that it disrupts rather than enlightens, overwhelms rather than nourishes.

Buddhism often warns against attachment to knowledge, reminding us that the finger pointing at the moon is not the moon itself. The wisdom of an enlightened master may appear as nonsense—or worse, a hindrance—to a beginner. If we are not careful, our hard-earned insights can become barriers instead of bridges.

The Buddha and the Art of Teaching

This is why the Buddha, and many other great teachers, did not simply hand people scriptures and expect them to understand. He spoke in parables, in metaphors drawn from the daily lives of his listeners. He encouraged direct experience and mindful inquiry. He did not overload students with truths they were not yet prepared to receive but instead led them step by step, encouraging self-discovery over passive reception.

A famous Buddhist story tells of a man wounded by a poisoned arrow. Instead of demanding to know who shot it, what kind of wood the arrow was made from, or the origin of the poison, the Buddha advised that the first priority should be to remove the arrow. In the same way, wisdom must be given in the proper sequence. We do not burden the beginner with the weight of ultimate truth but instead offer guidance suited to their needs.

The Responsibility of the Teacher

It is not enough to possess knowledge; we must cultivate the wisdom to share it skillfully. This means remembering what it was like to be lost, confused, and struggling. It means resisting the urge to hand down knowledge in its final form and instead guiding others along the path of discovery.

If we want to be good teachers, good mentors, good guides, we must resist the temptation to hand out stones when nourishment is needed. We must seek ways to make the unfamiliar familiar, to turn the opaque into the transparent, and to be patient as others take the same winding road we once walked.
