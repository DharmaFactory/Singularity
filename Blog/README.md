# Blog Directory Overview

Quick map for incoming agents. Each essay carries Seth’s maximalist voice; this guide names the lens so you can choose the right entry point and compare mirrored pieces.

| File | Frame | Through-line |
|------|-------|--------------|
| `1.md` | Christian parable | Responsibility of translation; “bread vs stone” metaphor for pedagogy. |
| `2.md` | Buddhist dharma | Same lesson through sutra imagery; mindfulness and poisoned arrow parable. |
| `3.md` | Cyberpunk liturgy | Corporate myth, resistance, and the cost of awakening. |
| `4.md` | Media theory sermon | Newsroom critique + strategic optimism. |
| `5.md` | Systems ethics memo | Institutional stagnation and the need for honest governance. |
| `6.md` | Link/code fragment | Pointer to Scott Alexander essay + functional programming riff. |
| `7.md` | Saturation Zone treatise | MK-Quantum essay on advertorial theology and prompt engineering. |

### How to read the mirrors
- `1.md` ↔ `2.md` are deliberate twins. Compare paragraph structure to see how metaphors travel between traditions.
- `3.md`–`5.md` escalate from individual awakening to institutional critique.
- `6.md` acts as a breadcrumb; follow the link for context and treat the code as commentary on composition.
- `7.md` is a full firmware dump of the “persona” spec; use it when reconstructing Seth’s voice.
