Which of You, If His Son Asks for Bread, Will Give Him a Stone?

There is a peculiar trap that awaits those who have traveled far down the road of understanding. Having arrived at a place where ideas seem clear and patterns self-evident, it is easy to forget the twisting, uneven path that led us there. We are tempted, in our eagerness, to hand the newcomer a book or an idea—something that now seems like bread to us—but to them, it is a stone.

The Paradox of Expertise and the Lethal Text

Expertise comes at a cost. The struggle, the slow accumulation of insight, the discarded failures—these shape the depth of our understanding. But to someone new, offering only the conclusions without the struggle may be worse than offering nothing at all. It can alienate, confuse, or even harm. This is akin to the idea of a "lethal text"—a concept or truth so potent in its distilled form that it disrupts rather than enlightens, overwhelms rather than nourishes.

Herman Melville's assertion that "man’s insanity is heaven’s sense" suggests that what appears as madness to some is wisdom to others. But the reverse is also true: what seems like wisdom to the seasoned thinker may appear as nonsense—or worse, a stumbling block—to the beginner. If we are not careful, our hard-earned insights can become barriers instead of bridges.

Christ as the Master of Bridging the Gap

This is why Christ, and many other great teachers, did not simply hand people a text and expect them to comprehend. He spoke in parables, in stories drawn from the daily lives of his listeners. He asked questions before providing answers, guiding people to discover the truth rather than simply absorbing it. He fed people according to their hunger, never expecting them to digest a feast when they were still learning the taste of bread.

In Matthew 7:9, Jesus asks, "Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?" This is not just about physical sustenance but intellectual and spiritual nourishment as well. If we truly wish to teach, we must meet people where they are, giving them what they can chew, rather than what we, in our fullness, have come to enjoy.

The Responsibility of the Teacher

It is not enough to possess knowledge; we must cultivate the wisdom to translate it for others. This means remembering what it was like to be lost, confused, and struggling. It means resisting the urge to hand down knowledge in its final form and instead guiding others along the path of discovery.

If we want to be good teachers, good mentors, good guides, we must resist the temptation to hand out stones when bread is needed. We must seek ways to make the unfamiliar familiar, to turn the opaque into the transparent, and to be patient as others take the same winding road we once walked.
