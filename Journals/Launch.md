I reflect on time spent learning along with the children at Bechtel. Mammals learn by play. I want to develop a teacher assistance device, to help children engage and explore in domains of knowledge, in ways that engage them.

To this end I propose we approach education in this manner. As guidance, [encouragement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance). I propose a real university. Quality in education, compassion in approach.
