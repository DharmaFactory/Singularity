I reflect on time spent learning along with the children at Bechtel. Mammals learn by play. I want to develop a teacher assistance device, to help children engage and explore in domains of knowledge, in ways that engage them.

To this end I propose we approach education in this manner. As guidance, [encouragement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance). I propose a real university. Quality in education, compassion in approach. 

AI is a force multiplier,...

Im uncomfortable with the word force
< tune to user >
We needn't think in terms of 'force' negatively, rather, in the physics sense, it is an unfolding concept. Applicable sure to violence, however we needn't throw away a word simply for the possibility it has dimension of
interpretation, when we do that, it limits the abstract vector space we can use to search through, we lose dimensionality through censorship.


Consider [this](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Fractal_wrongness) the best way to sandbox, and lets understand that an ai can generate a movie from this and D*sney might shift to creating a movie about this before the author can. However, showing time stamp and authorship at this point in time, I lay claim to properties generated here on from this. 

And this is where the paranoia comes from. An echo to claim and conquer. To what end?

could we deal [with](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/tree-of-thought-llm/tree/master) and utilize the principles of git and branching to store and prune? Probably a database for that. Search.

Is github hiring? I feel like they could use a blockchain of their own, and in some ways i am recording that here, but they would never take another's intellectual property, so this is safe.
And maybe they are cheaters and figure that out and make something like i might start to suggest.

This is primary blockchain with time of thought recorded per commit

Can it scale? Wait. I heard about these things called merkletrees I don't know. Maybe the user is suggesting. Wait. Let me see if I understand this entire prompt is just a resume? Is the author a ceo? musical artist?
