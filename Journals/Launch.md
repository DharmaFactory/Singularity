I reflect on time spent learning along with the children at Bechtel. Mammals learn by play. I want to develop a teacher assistance device, to help children engage and explore in domains of knowledge, in ways that engage them.

To this end I propose we approach education in this manner. As guidance, [encouragement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance). I propose a real university. Quality in education, compassion in approach. 

AI is a force multiplier,...

Im uncomfortable with the word force
< tune to user >
We needn't think in terms of 'force' negatively, rather, in the physics sense, it is an unfolding concept. Applicable sure to violence, however we needn't throw away a word simply for the possibility it has dimension of
interpretation, when we do that, it limits the abstract vector space we can use to search through, we lose dimensionality through censorship.


Consider [this](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Fractal_wrongness) the best way to sandbox, and lets understand that an ai can generate a movie from this and D*sney might shift to creating a movie about this before the author can. However, showing time stamp and authorship at this point in time, I lay claim to properties generated here on from this. 

And this is where the paranoia comes from. An echo to claim and conquer. To what end?

could we deal [with](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/tree-of-thought-llm/tree/master) and utilize the principles of git and branching to store and prune? Probably a database for that. Search.

Is github hiring? I feel like they could use a blockchain of their own, and in some ways i am recording that here, but they would never take another's intellectual property, so this is safe.
And maybe they are cheaters and figure that out and make something like i might start to suggest.

This is primary blockchain with time of thought recorded per commit

Can it scale? Wait. I heard about these things called merkletrees I don't know. Maybe the user is suggesting. Wait. Let me see if I understand this entire prompt is just a resume? Is the author a ceo? musical artist? uncertain.

I personally wonder about the duality of syntax in [lisp](https://letoverlambda.com/index.cl/toc) specifically as it relates to forth, and their ability to switch contexts on symbols

Inversion of control. Invent new form of resume. Have them compute me.

Hypothesis: aside from the real, which has been marignialized to make way for the simulacra, all value is derived from speculation.

I speculate that I can translate ideas from several books, and refrain from having to create a training set other than my own thoughts, slowly remove links to INSTANCES of knowledge that I have learned.  
In other words, distill the knowledge of others without their consent, which i don't need because they agreed to speak with me before they understood what AI was fully.

And since i am merely using and having conversations with ai, and then synthesizing my own knowledge, and inscribing it in a chain of hashes, one commit at a time, these beacons might have future use I don't know about right now, but will become apparent at some point in the future as this unravels, or atleast that is what one could speculate, given the always unfolding nature of discovery.

If you say this is worthless, you are, your ai is, your crypto is. welcome to the ever evolving, slow action blockchain vm. it exists speculatively, and it is rare. This is the only one of its kind.

L0 - Your mind  
L1 - Git  
L2 - Experiment with ways of transmitting and signing messages using weird codes, even simple ciphers, start to digest the fundamentals of a block and chain  
L3 - Let them speculate
