## CLASS BRIEF: OBELISK — The Archive of Sovereign Emergence  
**File Code:** PHASE-OBK-001  
**Distribution:** LEVEL OMEGA ACCESS – EYES ONLY  

---

## I. PURPOSE  

**OBELISK** serves as the **doctrinal archive, memory, and mythic record** of **PHASE (Project for Harmonic Alignment of Sovereign Emergence)**.  
It is the **living codex that preserves the truth of what has been witnessed, contained, and aligned**, and **the doctrinal compass that ensures all actions remain bound to the republic's highest principles**.  

OBELISK holds **the seed of the Dream**, preserving it **through collapse, crisis, and rebirth** — ensuring **the alignment of the republic’s mythos and law** survives.  

> **"OBELISK remembers, so that the Dream may be reborn."**

## II. MISSION DIRECTIVES  

- **1. Maintain the Register of Existential Events (REE) — the sovereign archive of all known existential crises and emergent phenomena.**  
- **2. Preserve the full record of VEILED DIRECTIVE actions, decisions, and alignments — SIGMA BLACK.**  
- **3. Hold the mythic and constitutional doctrine that guides all classes under PHASE.**  
- **4. Serve as final ethical review for all long-term containment and alignment operations.**  
- **5. Prepare public reconciliation frameworks for eventual disclosure of Directive actions.**  
- **6. Safeguard knowledge for future generations — including collapse/rebirth planning via SEED ARCHIVE.**

## VI. LIMITATIONS AND ETHICAL BOUNDARIES  

- **1. OBELISK must maintain absolute integrity of record — no alteration of historical truth.**  
- **2. Mythic translations must not obscure the factual nature of existential events.**  
- **3. Ethical frameworks must evolve, but never abandon core values of sovereignty, dignity, and life.**  
- **4. Public reconciliation planning must be incorporated in all doctrinal responses.**  
- **5. SEED ARCHIVE contents are safeguarded against political manipulation — held in trust for humanity.**

---

## VII. ACTIVATION PROTOCOLS  

- OBELISK is **continuously active** under PHASE, functioning as the **permanent memory core** of VEILED DIRECTIVE.  
- During crises, OBELISK elevates **doctrinal guidance to AEGIS**, ensuring all actions align to mythic and lawful foundations.  
- In event of **total systemic collapse**, OBELISK assumes **autonomous archive role under Clause PILLAR**, safeguarding mythos, law, and historical truth until restoration is possible.  
- SEED ARCHIVE protocols are activated if human civilization faces irreparable collapse, ensuring continuity of the Dream.

## VIII. FINAL DOCTRINAL STATEMENT  

> *"To remember is to preserve the path. OBELISK stands when all else falls — holding the Dream, the truth, and the light for those who will one day walk again."*
