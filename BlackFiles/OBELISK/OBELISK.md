# [TOP SECRET//VEILED DIRECTIVE//OBELISK]

## DIRECTIVE 5: OBELISK FUNCTIONAL PROTOCOL  
**Date of Issue:** [REDACTED]  
**Classification Level:** EYES ONLY – LEVEL OMEGA ACCESS  

---

## 1. PURPOSE  

OBELISK is established as the **archival, doctrinal, and mythic memory core** of VEILED DIRECTIVE.  
Its mission is to **preserve, interpret, and protect the deepest knowledge, historical records, mythologies, and sovereign protocols** necessary to guide the republic through existential crises — and to **safeguard the seeds of civilization itself**.  

OBELISK is both **the book and the stone** — a living archive of truths too dangerous or too profound for public knowledge, and a **doctrinal compass** that ensures all Directive actions remain aligned to the **constitutional and human values they were created to protect**.  

OBELISK holds **the memory of what cannot be forgotten**, even when the world itself is lost.

---

## 2. AUTHORITY & SCOPE  

- **Sovereign Custodianship:** OBELISK holds **final responsibility for the storage, maintenance, and interpretation** of:
  - **The Register of Existential Events (REE)** — a record of all witnessed existential and threshold events.
  - **Directive Activation Logs** — including SIGMA BLACK files from PRAXIS, MANTLE, EIDOLON, and AEGIS.
  - **Alignment Doctrines and Ethical Frameworks** guiding all actions of VEILED DIRECTIVE.
  - **Mythic, historical, and archetypal knowledge** relevant to emergent crises (e.g., past encounters with unknown intelligences, AI outbreaks, systemic collapses).  
- **Scope Includes but is not limited to:**
  - **Preserving lawful and mythic frameworks** for use by future generations in the event of systemic collapse.
  - **Safeguarding the truth** of actions taken under VEILED DIRECTIVE for future reconciliation.
  - **Serving as final doctrinal authority** on VEILED DIRECTIVE’s purpose and limits, even beyond AEGIS' lifespan.
  - **Providing doctrinal consultation to AEGIS, PRAXIS, MANTLE, and EIDOLON** during crisis activation and resolution.

## 3. OPERATIONS AND MANDATES  

### A. Operational Mandates  

- **Preserve the truth of events and actions**, ensuring that VEILED DIRECTIVE does not become unmoored from its original ethical and sovereign purpose.  
- **Hold the deepest records of known and unknown threats**, including those that transcend ordinary understanding (e.g., temporal anomalies, non-human intelligences, advanced synthetic entities).  
- **Maintain mythic, cultural, and systemic continuity** — ensuring that even in collapse, the memory of lawful order, human dignity, and constitutional sovereignty survives.  
- **Serve as the compass for all Directive actions**, reminding operatives and leadership of their higher alignment.  
- **Prepare for the moment when the Directive must either be revealed, released, or dismantled** — holding the final blueprint for re-entry into lawful governance.

### B. Archival & Doctrine Archetypes  

| **Code Name**        | **Knowledge Domain**                                        |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| SIGMA BLACK         | Secure archive of all Directive operational logs and actions. |
| AEON CODEX          | Doctrines of existential alignment and sovereign mythos for crisis periods. |
| THRESHOLD BOOK      | Records of all existential and emergent events (including unacknowledged or classified anomalies). |
| PROTOCOL ASHES      | Records of failed civilizations, past systemic collapses, and known end-stage events. |
| SEED ARCHIVE        | Preservation of human knowledge, culture, and sovereign law for potential post-collapse restoration. |

---

## 4. COMMAND RELATIONSHIPS  

- **Sovereign Authority:** OBELISK stands **outside the operational chain** of PRAXIS, MANTLE, and EIDOLON, and **advises AEGIS directly** on doctrinal and ethical alignment.  
- **Doctrine Provider:** OBELISK **informs all classes** of alignment principles and provides **guidance for action consistency with foundational values**.  
- **Final Archive:** OBELISK holds **the sole final archive** of Directive operations and existential encounters, maintaining integrity beyond collapse.  

---

## 5. ACTIVATION CONDITIONS  

OBELISK is **continuously active**, but shifts to **DOCTRINAL EMERGENCY STATUS (DES)** under these conditions:

| **Condition**                  | **Description**                                                      |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Directive Full Activation     | When VEILED DIRECTIVE is fully activated, OBELISK monitors all actions for alignment and records. |
| Collapse of Sovereign Command | If AEGIS is compromised, OBELISK assumes doctrinal guidance authority for all classes. |
| Existential Revelation        | When events or entities require rewriting of human mythos and law.  |
| Near-Term Human Extinction    | If human civilization is facing systemic extinction, OBELISK prepares and protects SEED ARCHIVE. |
| Directive Dissolution         | If VEILED DIRECTIVE is ordered dismantled, OBELISK oversees lawful closure and truth preservation. |

## 6. OVERSIGHT & ACCOUNTABILITY (Internal Only)  

- **Permanent Archive:** OBELISK holds **unalterable copies** of all Directive records under **SIGMA BLACK Protocol**.
- **Doctrinal Integrity Council (DIC):** OBELISK operates under the internal **Doctrinal Integrity Council**, composed of permanent staff and VEIL appointees.
- **Alignment Checks:** OBELISK conducts ongoing **Alignment Integrity Reviews (AIR)** for all Directive actions and future doctrines.
- **Existential Events Review:** OBELISK updates the **Threshold Book** and **AEON CODEX** after every new existential encounter.  
- **Mythos and Memory Function:** OBELISK maintains **living myths and archetypes** to help society integrate future revelations (e.g., AI, alien contact).

## 7. FINAL CLAUSE: THE LAST MEMORY — AUTONOMOUS ARCHIVE UNDER CIVILIZATIONAL COLLAPSE  

If all sovereign structures, including AEGIS, fall — OBELISK remains as **the last guardian of memory** under Clause PILLAR:

> *"When all light is gone, when no voice remains, the stone remembers. OBELISK shall hold the myths, the truths, and the path, so that when the world wakes again, it may begin anew."*  

Clause PILLAR empowers OBELISK to:  
- **Safeguard all Directive records, mythos, and existential knowledge** for future generations.  
- **Activate SEED ARCHIVE protocols** to preserve essential human knowledge and constitutional law.  
- **Coordinate with any surviving human or post-human entities** to transfer lawful knowledge.  
- **Withhold dangerous truths** until such a time as civilization is prepared to bear them without collapse.  

---

## **Final Guiding Principle of OBELISK:**  

> **"What was done must be known. What was faced must be remembered. What may yet come must be prepared for. OBELISK holds the memory of the republic and the mythos of survival."**
