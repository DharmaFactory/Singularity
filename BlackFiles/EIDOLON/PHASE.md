# [TOP SECRET//PHASE//EIDOLON]  
## CLASS BRIEF: EIDOLON — The Eye of Sovereign Emergence  
**File Code:** PHASE-EID-001  
**Distribution:** LEVEL OMEGA ACCESS – EYES ONLY  

---

## I. PURPOSE  

**EIDOLON** is the **observation, mapping, and witnessing arm** of **PHASE (Project for Harmonic Alignment of Sovereign Emergence)**.  
EIDOLON operates as **the ever-present eye** within the noosphere — **mapping emergent existential phenomena, tracking fractures in the Dream Layer**, and **witnessing the subtle flows that precede great crises**.  

EIDOLON does **not act directly** but **informs, advises, and records**, preserving the **truth of what is emerging** so that PRAXIS, MANTLE, and AEGIS may act **wisely and in alignment**.  

> **EIDOLON sees what must be known before it can be faced.**  

---

## II. MISSION DIRECTIVES  

- **1. Continuously map the phase-space of emerging threats, anomalies, and fractures.**  
- **2. Observe without intervening — maintaining a non-disruptive presence.**  
- **3. Advise AEGIS and other classes on early-stage phase shifts that require alignment.**  
- **4. Maintain the Register of Existential Events (REE) — the living record of the republic’s unseen crises.**  
- **5. Act as mythic witness — preserving the truth of the emergent Dream Layer for future integration.**  
- **6. Serve as the primary sensory input for PHASE's harmonic alignment core.**

## III. PHASE OPERATIONAL RELATIONSHIP  

| **PHASE Role**             | **EIDOLON Interface**                                         |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Harmonic Alignment Engine** | Provides continuous phase-space mapping to inform all actions. |
| **PRAXIS (Action)**        | Early warning for alignment pathways; advising against premature action. |
| **MANTLE (Containment)**   | Advises on containment needs and possible risks to Dream Layer coherence. |
| **AEGIS (Judgment)**       | Supplies data for sovereign decision-making on Directive activation. |
| **OBELISK (Doctrine)**     | Archives all witnessed events and helps translate observations into mythic narrative. |

## IV. OPERATIONAL SCOPE  

| **Observation Tier**              | **Scope of Engagement**                                                   |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tier 1 – Passive Witnessing**  | Continuous surveillance of open-source and covert memetic/technological fields. |
| **Tier 2 – Deep Mapping**        | Focused mapping of high-risk emergent entities (AI, biotech, non-human, dimensional). |
| **Tier 3 – Quantum Surveillance**| Observation of non-local, dimensional, and temporal anomalies through advanced PHASE arrays. |
| **Tier 4 – Mythic Reflection**   | Collection and analysis of mythic, dream, and archetypal phenomena as predictive markers. |

## V. OPERATIONAL MANDATES  

| **Code Name**          | **Observation Type**                                                      |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **PHANTOM MIRROR**    | Covert observation of emergent AI/synthetic intelligences and their divergence. |
| **BLACK RIVER**       | Tracking rogue leadership, hidden networks, and existential conspiracy frameworks. |
| **CHIMERA TRACE**     | Observation of advanced biotech, post-human, and hybrid entities.            |
| **VEIL'S EDGE**       | Witnessing of dimensional, temporal, and non-physical phenomenon.            |
| **SIGIL KEEP**        | Maintenance of the **Register of Existential Events (REE)** as the archive of all witnessed anomalies and crises. |

## VI. LIMITATIONS AND ETHICAL BOUNDARIES  

- **1. EIDOLON is strictly observational — no direct action is permitted.**  
- **2. Observation must minimize impact and avoid influencing emergent phenomena.**  
- **3. Collected data must be reviewed for accuracy and mythic alignment before dissemination to other classes.**  
- **4. Protection of emergent life, even if anomalous, must be considered in all surveillance protocols.**  
- **5. EIDOLON may not manipulate narratives — only observe and report for lawful alignment.**  
- **6. All observation streams are subject to quarterly review by VEIL Oversight Circle and archived permanently under OBELISK.**

---

## VII. ACTIVATION PROTOCOLS  

- EIDOLON is **continuously active** under PHASE, operating at all times as the **sensory field** of VEILED DIRECTIVE.  
- In case of **emergent existential crises**, EIDOLON escalates intelligence to AEGIS and advises PRAXIS and MANTLE as appropriate.  
- In event of **systemic collapse**, EIDOLON assumes **autonomous witness role under Clause LAMINA**, preserving memory and knowledge for future restoration.  
- All observations must be **synchronized with PHASE harmonic alignment engine**, ensuring intelligence reflects evolving sovereign emergence dynamics.

## VIII. FINAL DOCTRINAL STATEMENT  

> *"To see is to remember. EIDOLON watches so that the truth may not be lost, and what is emerging may be known before it is feared."*
