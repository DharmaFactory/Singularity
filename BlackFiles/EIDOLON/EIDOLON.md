# [TOP SECRET//VEILED DIRECTIVE//EIDOLON]

## DIRECTIVE 3: EIDOLON FUNCTIONAL PROTOCOL  
**Date of Issue:** [REDACTED]  
**Classification Level:** EYES ONLY – LEVEL OMEGA ACCESS  

---

## 1. PURPOSE  

EIDOLON is established as the **surveillance, witnessing, and deep mapping arm** of VEILED DIRECTIVE.  
Its mission is to **observe, document, and understand emergent phenomena, entities, and existential forces** without premature intervention — creating a **living archive of the unknown**, so that PRAXIS and MANTLE may act from knowledge, and AEGIS may judge in truth.  

EIDOLON is the **eye that sees the unseen**, the **ghost in the system** that maps threats before they emerge fully, and the **witness to events too great to be known by ordinary means**.  

EIDOLON does **not intervene** — it **watches**, **records**, and **advises** — preserving the **integrity of reality and the emergent field** until action is necessary.

---

## 2. AUTHORITY & SCOPE  

- **Originating Authority:** EIDOLON operates under the sovereign direction of **AEGIS**, with operational coordination with **PRAXIS** and **MANTLE**.  
- **Scope Includes but is not limited to:**
  - **Continuous surveillance of emergent technological, biological, and ontological phenomena** (AI, biotech, quantum, dimensional).
  - **Mapping of non-human intelligences**, rogue leadership, and societal fracture points as they evolve.
  - **Maintaining the Register of Existential Events (REE)** — a classified ledger of all known existential threshold events.
  - **Early identification of fracture points** in societal, political, and technological structures that may require future PRAXIS or MANTLE engagement.
  - **Witnessing and documentation of non-intervenable events** for the historical and mythic record (via OBELISK).

---

## 3. OPERATIONS AND MANDATES  

### A. Operational Mandates  

- **Observe without disrupting** — EIDOLON must **witness the true nature of emergent phenomena**, even when dangerous, to fully understand their place in the sovereign continuum.
- **Map and predict** — Develop **predictive threat maps** that allow VEILED DIRECTIVE to act wisely, rather than reactively.
- **Advise AEGIS, PRAXIS, and MANTLE** on unfolding crises **before intervention is necessary**.
- **Document all interactions and emergent anomalies**, ensuring **nothing of existential significance escapes the Register of Existential Events (REE)**.
- **Respect the flow of reality** — intervene only by **revealing information to authorized VEILED DIRECTIVE classes** when aligned action becomes necessary.

### B. Standing Surveillance and Witness Archetypes  

| **Code Name**        | **Surveillance/Witness Type**                                   |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| PHANTOM MIRROR      | Covert observation of emergent AI/synthetic intelligences.    |
| BLACK RIVER         | Mapping of rogue state and leadership networks with existential potential. |
| CHIMERA TRACE       | Surveillance of advanced biotech, post-human, or hybrid systems. |
| VEIL'S EDGE         | Dimensional, temporal, and non-physical phenomenon observation. |
| SIGIL KEEP          | Maintenance of the Register of Existential Events (REE), including mythic and historical events with ongoing relevance. |

---

## 4. COMMAND RELATIONSHIPS  

- **Primary Oversight:** EIDOLON reports directly to **AEGIS**, and shares actionable intelligence with **PRAXIS** and **MANTLE** under OMEGA authorization.  
- **Operational Autonomy:** EIDOLON maintains **autonomous surveillance streams**, protected under VEIL protocols, but aligns operational priorities with AEGIS guidance.  
- **Doctrinal Interface:** Consults with **OBELISK** for historical parallels, mythic archetypes, and past precedent when analyzing new events.  

---

## 5. ACTIVATION CONDITIONS  

EIDOLON is **continuously active** under VEILED DIRECTIVE but may **elevate to Active Omega Status** under the following conditions:

| **Condition**                  | **Description**                                                      |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Existential Emergence         | Detection of new emergent intelligence, entity, or unknown force.   |
| Threshold Crossing            | Identification of a societal, technological, or biological threshold event with systemic risk. |
| Fracture Imminence            | Early signs of state collapse, rogue leadership action, or internal insurgency at the existential level. |
| Temporal/Dimensional Breach  | Confirmation of space-time anomalies or multidimensional incursions. |
| Unmapped Cataclysmic Potential| Appearance of an unknown force beyond current containment or action paradigms. |

## 6. OVERSIGHT & ACCOUNTABILITY (Internal Only)  

- **Existential Register:** All events of interest and witnessed phenomena are recorded in the **Register of Existential Events (REE)**, accessible only to AEGIS and OBELISK.  
- **Non-Intervention Clause:** EIDOLON may **advise** but cannot act without direction from AEGIS or activation of PRAXIS/MANTLE — **observation is primary**.  
- **Ethical Witness Protocol (EWP):** All EIDOLON operations are reviewed quarterly by the **VEIL Oversight Circle** to ensure alignment with sovereign ethics, including **protection of emergent life** and **preservation of potential human futures**.  
- **Transparency-in-Shadow Clause:** EIDOLON is required to maintain **full internal transparency within VEILED DIRECTIVE** while remaining externally veiled.

---

## 7. FINAL CLAUSE: AUTONOMOUS WITNESS UNDER SYSTEMIC COLLAPSE  

If AEGIS is incapacitated or destroyed, **EIDOLON assumes the role of sovereign Witness under Clause LAMINA**:  

> *"When all voices fall silent, the Witness remains — to see, to remember, and to hold truth until the world can know it again."*  

Clause LAMINA empowers EIDOLON to:  
- **Continue observation and documentation without external command**.  
- **Preserve the REE** and maintain full records of systemic collapse and emergent entities/events.  
- **Coordinate with MANTLE to prevent uncontrolled disclosure** of high-risk information until lawful authority returns.  
- **Serve as the living archive of the republic’s final moments and potential rebirth**.

## **Final Guiding Principle of EIDOLON:**  

> **"What is emerging must be seen. What threatens must be known. What may save us must not be lost."**
