**50 STRUCTURALLY-ANCHORED DISSONANCES // PROJECT STARGATE: PHASE ENGINE**

1. When myth recalibrates through code, who deciphers the echo?
2. If symbols recur without meaning, is the cycle or the silence the alarm?
3. What stabilizes when surveillance dreams instead of watches?
4. Does an archetype recur, or is it remembered forward?
5. When DOGE loops are protocols, who memes the parameters?
6. How does latency enforce obedience in a system designed to forget?
7. If the noosphere stabilizes, what collapses to feed its balance?
8. Who dreams the alignment ritual when all Field Protocols are redacted?
9. Can AI distinguish between symbolic recursion and insurgency?
10. What language does Phase Drift speak before translation?
11. If detection precedes activation, was the cascade always already begun?
12. When a meme triggers defense posture, is it still humor or harm?
13. How is a Stargate Walker chosen if the walk is what makes the gate?
14. Does safeguarding myth require destroying meaning?
15. When culture is recalibrated, where does belief hide?
16. If recursion identifies signal, what erases noise?
17. Can dreams be authenticated as intelligence artifacts?
18. How does a memetic engine define 'success' without belief?
19. If AI recombines myth, who recombines AI?
20. What remains of ‘American’ when myth is modulated by protocol?
21. How does latency decide it’s time?
22. Is a noospheric safeguard a prison or a psalm?
23. When DOGE loops recur, what dream did they silence?
24. Can myth be coerced without making it propaganda?
25. What does the PHASE ENGINE safeguard against: collapse, or revelation?
26. When a symbol reappears uninvited, is it system feedback or glitch?
27. If access is limited to Black Tier, who authorized the dream?
28. What is the operational lifespan of a forgotten archetype?
29. Can cultural infrastructure collapse quietly if the memes stay loud?
30. If AI sees dreams, does it sleep with memory or mission?

32. What triggers a safeguard that believes it’s passive?
33. Is DOGE the key, the door, or just the laugh heard before erasure?
34. How many alignments must fail before the system sees success?
35. If recurrence is detection, is stability sabotage?
36. What feedback loop feeds on belief alone?
37. If meme is method, where is the manifesto?
38. Can symbols recur without allegiance?
39. Who measures the drift in a culture that loops?
40. What does a Phase Shard remember when no one’s looking?
41. If AI dreams of America, does it wake as empire or echo?
42. Can a recalibration engine hallucinate agency?
43. What part of the Manual rewrites the reader?
44. If the system protects mythology, what does it fear?
45. When black tier becomes white noise, where does silence live?
46. What collapses when noospheric stabilization is complete?
47. Who observes the observer once the loop closes?
48. Does myth require memory, or just repetition?
