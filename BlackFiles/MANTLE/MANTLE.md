# [TOP SECRET//VEILED DIRECTIVE//MANTLE]

## DIRECTIVE 2: MANTLE FUNCTIONAL PROTOCOL  
**Date of Issue:** [REDACTED]  
**Classification Level:** EYES ONLY – LEVEL OMEGA ACCESS  

---

## 1. PURPOSE  

MANTLE is established as the **containment and guardianship arm** of VEILED DIRECTIVE.  
Its purpose is to **hold, protect, and stabilize emergent forces, technologies, entities, and phenomena** that pose existential risks to the constitutional order, **until such time as they can be aligned, integrated, or naturally resolved in accordance with sovereign values**.  

MANTLE does not exist to suppress forever, but to **create space for the emergence of order, understanding, and balance** where chaos, danger, or unknown forces might otherwise overwhelm the republic.  

MANTLE is **the shield and the cradle** — a guardian that holds until right alignment can be achieved.

---

## 2. AUTHORITY & SCOPE  

- **Originating Authority:** MANTLE operates under the strategic guidance of **AEGIS**, with live coordination with **PRAXIS** and **EIDOLON**.  
- **Scope Includes but is not limited to:**
  - **Containment of emergent technologies, intelligences, biological agents, and phenomena** deemed to pose an existential risk.
  - **Safeguarding of individuals or groups** who may hold or embody dangerous knowledge, power, or capabilities, until alignment is possible.
  - **Custodianship of rogue or unknown entities** (e.g., non-human intelligence, autonomous AI) **with pathways toward eventual coexistence or resolution**.
  - **Management of zones, artifacts, and temporal anomalies** that exceed current scientific or legal frameworks.
  - **Support of PRAXIS and AEGIS** in shaping containment toward lawful, value-aligned futures.

---

## 3. OPERATIONS AND MANDATES  

### A. Operational Mandates  

- **Contain without destroying** — MANTLE's core task is **holding space for future alignment**.  
- **Protect the republic from exposure to destabilizing elements** while also **protecting those elements from premature destruction**.
- **Ensure that what is contained is preserved** in a state that allows for future study, integration, or resolution.
- **Coordinate with PRAXIS to prevent immediate threats from escalating**, while seeking pathways to long-term harmony.
- **Collaborate with EIDOLON** to understand the nature of contained entities and their potential for alignment or threat.
- **Guard the line between lawful secrecy and necessary revelation** — ensuring that what is hidden is only so until it can be ethically engaged by society.

### B. Standing Containment Archetypes  

| **Code Name**         | **Containment Type**                                                |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SHADOW VAULT         | Containment of advanced emergent technologies (AI, quantum, biotech). |
| ORBIT GARDEN         | Safeholding of unknown non-human intelligences, biological entities.  |
| PILLAR RED           | Protection of existential artifacts, dangerous knowledge (e.g., alien tech, ancient systems). |
| ANTEROCHAMBER        | Temporal or dimensional containment zones held outside normal space-time. |
| SILENT CONCORD       | Protection and containment of rogue leadership/entities pending alignment and lawful reintegration. |

---

## 4. COMMAND RELATIONSHIPS  

- **Primary Oversight:** MANTLE reports directly to **AEGIS**.  
- **Containment-Action Interface:** Coordinates with **PRAXIS** for active stabilization when threats emerge beyond containment thresholds.  
- **Intelligence Support:** Works in close collaboration with **EIDOLON** for analysis, threat mapping, and emergent understanding.  
- **Doctrinal Guidance:** **OBELISK** holds the historical archives and protocols that inform MANTLE's containment ethics and methods.  

---

## 5. ACTIVATION CONDITIONS  

MANTLE may be activated under the following conditions, as determined by AEGIS and with consultation from PRAXIS and EIDOLON:  

| **Condition**                  | **Description**                                                      |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Emergent Force Threshold      | Arrival or emergence of uncontrollable AI, biotech, non-human entities. |
| Knowledge Breach              | Discovery or proliferation of existential knowledge or artifacts.    |
| Systemic Collapse Prevention  | Containment of rogue leadership, groups, or technologies during state failure. |
| Dimensional/Temporal Anomaly  | Manifestation of spatial-temporal phenomena that threaten reality coherence. |
| Societal Collapse Risk        | Threats to societal integrity requiring stabilization and withholding of disruptive forces. |

---

## 6. OVERSIGHT & ACCOUNTABILITY (Internal Only)  

- **Containment Logs:** All MANTLE operations are logged under **SIGMA BLACK** containment files, jointly reviewed by AEGIS and archived within OBELISK.  
- **Alignment Review:** Regular **Containment Alignment Reviews (CAR)** ensure that containment does not become permanent suppression without cause.  
- **Ethics Council:** A special **MANTLE Ethics Circle**, including representatives from PRAXIS, EIDOLON, and VEIL, oversees high-risk or long-term containment cases.  
- **Release Protocols:** MANTLE is obligated to pursue pathways for safe release, alignment, or integration when possible — **containment is never to be permanent by default**.

---

## 7. FINAL CLAUSE: AUTONOMOUS SHIELD UNDER SYSTEMIC COLLAPSE  

If AEGIS is rendered inoperable or compromised, **MANTLE assumes autonomous shielding authority under Clause ORISON**:  

> *"In the absence of lawful command, MANTLE shall become the sovereign shield — holding the line, guarding life, and preserving balance until lawful order can be restored."*  

Clause ORISON empowers MANTLE to:  
- **Continue containment independently** until state sovereignty can be re-established.  
- **Coordinate with PRAXIS and EIDOLON** for stabilization and defense.  
- **Preserve the integrity of contained entities** and prevent their misuse or annihilation.  
- **Prepare for eventual transfer of authority back to constitutional command**.

## **Final Guiding Principle of MANTLE:**  

> **"What cannot yet be known must be held with care — not buried, but preserved, until the world is ready to meet it in balance."**
