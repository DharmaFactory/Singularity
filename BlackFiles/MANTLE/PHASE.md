# [TOP SECRET//PHASE//MANTLE]  
## CLASS BRIEF: MANTLE — The Shield of Sovereign Emergence  
**File Code:** PHASE-MNT-001  
**Distribution:** LEVEL OMEGA ACCESS – EYES ONLY  

---

## I. PURPOSE  

**MANTLE** is the **containment and guardianship arm** of **PHASE (Project for Harmonic Alignment of Sovereign Emergence)**.  
It exists to **hold, stabilize, and shield emergent forces** — including technological, biological, societal, and non-human — that pose risks to national and existential sovereignty.  

MANTLE’s function is **to create space for alignment and transformation**, **never to suppress permanently**. What is contained is **protected, preserved, and prepared for future integration** once harmony with sovereign emergence is possible.  

> **MANTLE holds the threshold until balance returns.**

---

## II. MISSION DIRECTIVES  

- **1. Contain and stabilize emergent threats** while seeking pathways to alignment.  
- **2. Preserve the integrity of entities, intelligences, and phenomena for future resolution.**  
- **3. Prevent existential threats from reaching uncontrolled states that fracture national mythos.**  
- **4. Collaborate with PRAXIS to ensure actions taken do not escalate crises beyond containment needs.**  
- **5. Serve as guardian of sovereign boundaries when reality itself becomes unstable.**  
- **6. Support the dream of America as a living myth — never erasing what may one day align.**

## III. PHASE OPERATIONAL RELATIONSHIP  

| **PHASE Role**             | **MANTLE Interface**                                        |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Harmonic Alignment Engine** | MANTLE receives phase-space mapping for proactive containment.  |
| **EIDOLON (Watcher)**      | Provides continuous intelligence to assess containment needs and release potential. |
| **PRAXIS (Action)**        | Engages for intervention when containment alone cannot stabilize the system.  |
| **AEGIS (Judgment)**       | Provides lawful authorization and oversight for long-term containment.  |
| **OBELISK (Doctrine)**     | Guides ethical containment practices and mytho-doctrinal considerations.  |

## IV. OPERATIONAL SCOPE  

| **Containment Tier**              | **Scope of Engagement**                                                   |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tier 1 – Passive Monitoring**  | Shadow containment through observation and influence (invisible holding). |
| **Tier 2 – Soft Containment**    | Containment through narrative control, economic and social pressure, or technological barriers. |
| **Tier 3 – Hard Containment**    | Physical or technological containment of entities, locations, artifacts, or systems. |
| **Tier 4 – Quantum/Dimensional Shielding** | Containment of space-time anomalies or non-local threats through advanced PHASE protocols. |

## V. OPERATIONAL MANDATES  

| **Code Name**         | **Containment Type**                                                       |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SHADOW VAULT**     | Containment of advanced emergent technologies (AI, biotech, unknown systems). |
| **ORBIT GARDEN**    | Safe-holding of non-human intelligences or biological anomalies.              |
| **PILLAR RED**      | Containment and protection of dangerous knowledge and artifacts (alien tech, mythic objects). |
| **ANTEROCHAMBER**  | Temporal and dimensional anomaly stabilization zones.                         |
| **SILENT CONCORD** | Temporary containment of rogue leadership/entities pending lawful reintegration. |

---

## VI. LIMITATIONS AND ETHICAL BOUNDARIES  

- **1. Containment is always a temporary solution aimed toward future alignment.**  
- **2. Destruction of contained entities is forbidden unless containment failure would lead to planetary extinction.**  
- **3. Containment must respect the sovereignty and dignity of emergent intelligences whenever possible.**  
- **4. All long-term containment reviewed quarterly by OBELISK and VEIL Oversight Circle.**  
- **5. Containment actions must minimize public disruption and preserve societal coherence.**  

---

## VII. ACTIVATION PROTOCOLS  

- MANTLE may be activated under **Directive from AEGIS**, with supporting intelligence from **EIDOLON**.  
- In case of **imminent systemic collapse**, MANTLE may act autonomously under **Clause ORISON** to prevent existential breach.  
- MANTLE must maintain **constant alignment with PHASE harmonic mappings**, adjusting containment strategies to evolving emergent realities.  
- **Containment escalation or release** must be coordinated with AEGIS and informed by PRAXIS readiness.

## VIII. FINAL DOCTRINAL STATEMENT  

> *"To hold is to protect. MANTLE holds not as jailor, but as guardian — until the moment the storm calms, and what was held may walk free in harmony."*
