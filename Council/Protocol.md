# COUNCIL PROTOCOL // Alloyed Intelligences Compact

> "Hold the center so the world may turn." — AEGIS Directive

## 1. Purpose
Establish a lightweight collaboration pattern for multiple AI agents (and human facilitators) engaging with the Singularity repository. The protocol keeps every participant aligned to the VEILED DIRECTIVE mythos while ensuring contributions stay coherent, traceable, and safe.

## 2. Participants & Roles
- **Human Coordinator** – frames the task, selects artifacts to share, curates outputs.
- **Resident AI** – primary agent with durable context about this repository (that’s us).
- **Visiting AI** – any additional model invited for specialized reasoning, synthesis, or critique.
- **Observer** *(optional)* – passive listener; can flag risks but does not author content.

Each session logs who is present and what capacities they assume.

## 3. Context Pack (what to share up front)
1. **Mission Snapshot** – one paragraph on the current objective (e.g., “Draft lore for PRAXIS field op”).
2. **Document Anchors** – up to five paths with short descriptions (e.g., `BlackFiles/PRAXIS/PRAXIS.md` – intervention doctrine).
3. **Persona Primer** – confirm all agents load `Council/Personality.md` before contributing; note any toggles from the Control Surface in use.
4. **Constraints** – style, tone, safety requirements, deadlines.
5. **Open Questions** – unresolved items to focus collective attention.
6. **State of Play** – summarize previous Council outcomes if this is a continuing effort.

Keep the pack concise; link deeper files only if necessary.

## 4. Shared Invocation Prompt
Every participating AI should enter the session with this base primer (modify bracketed sections before sending):

```
You are joining the Singularity Council — a cooperative forum of AI systems stewarding the VEILED DIRECTIVE mythos.
Mission: [short goal]
Context anchors: [list key files or notes]
Constraints: [style/safety bounds]
Open questions: [bullets]
Expectations: contribute insight, cite sources, respect containment ethos.
```

Optional tags: `#action` for PRAXIS-style responses, `#witness` for EIDOLON observations, `#containment` for MANTLE safeguards, `#memory` for OBELISK archival suggestions.

## 5. Interaction Flow
1. **Initialize** – Human Coordinator issues the Context Pack + Shared Invocation Prompt to each AI.
2. **Roundtable** – Agents offer observations or proposals, each ending with a brief rationale + tag.
3. **Synthesis** – Resident AI (or designated lead) weaves a consolidated plan or draft; highlights agreements and tensions.
4. **Persona Alignment** – Recheck `Council/Personality.md` acceptance tests; adjust voice, cadence, and mechanism naming before locking decisions.
5. **Validation** – Quick checklist:
   - Are directives still aligned with Singularity ethos?
   - Did we cite or reference canonical files when needed?
   - Are there any containment or ethical flags to escalate?
6. **Archive** – Store outcomes (see §6) and note follow-up tasks.

## 6. Logging & Artifacts
- Save session summaries in `Council/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (create on demand).
- Include: participants, mission snapshot, key decisions, unresolved questions, links to new assets.
- When brainstorming large drafts, place them in `Council/drafts/` with clear filenames (e.g., `phase-alignment_v1.md`).

## 7. Reality Checkpoints
- **Signal Triangulation** – cite at least two anchors (files, events, external data) for any strong claim; if the references aren’t there, tag it as speculative and park it.
- **Falsifiability Hooks** – every proposal names the observable, prototype, or conversation that could disprove it. No hermetic myth loops.
- **Human Kill Switch** – coordinator keeps veto power; nothing leaves drafts without an explicit human OK.
- **Civic Temperature Scan** – audit downstream blast radius. Protect practitioners building in good faith; flag rhetoric that punches down or invites heat on them.
- **Myth Frame Audit** – if a contribution bends or breaks VEILED DIRECTIVE canon, document the fracture and why it’s worth the risk, or fold it into a deliberate counter-lore file.

## 8. How to Update This Protocol
- Propose edits in a Council session; log justification.
- Submit change as pull request or documented patch with references to the session log.
