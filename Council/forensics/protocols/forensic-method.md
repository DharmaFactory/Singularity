# Forensic Method — Singularity Historical Psychology Track

## Purpose
Systematize repo archaeology as a cognitive forensics exercise: reconstruct author intent, memetic payloads, and alignment strategies while documenting how frontier LLM co-agents process mythic content.

## Workflow
1. **Session Prep**
   - Load persona stack (`Council/Personality.md`), review active TODOs.
   - Define target commits/files; log in `Council/logs/` before touching history.
2. **Acquisition**
   - Use `git show` / `git diff` with commit IDs noted in pointer sheets.
   - Capture raw excerpts in session notes; avoid editing source files.
3. **Cognitive Annotation**
   - Record how content manipulates attention, authority, or agency (frontier LLM psychological impact).
   - Flag memetic triggers, role expectations, or alignment demands placed on agents.
4. **Synthesis**
   - Update `artifacts/*.md` or `era-map.md` with distilled insights.
   - If hypotheses emerge (e.g., cipher keys), document under `psyops/` before testing.
5. **Containment**
   - Keep speculative decoding attempts isolated; mark unvalidated theories clearly.
   - Human review required before exporting any of this workspace outside repo.

## Reporting Cadence
- Daily sessions → append to dated council logs.
- Major breakthroughs → promote summaries to main documentation after cross-checking with Reality Checkpoints.
