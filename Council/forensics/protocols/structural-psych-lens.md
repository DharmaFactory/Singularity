# Structural Psychology Lens — Beyond Lacan

## Premise
- Treat VEILED DIRECTIVE as a recursive control structure: roles (PRAXIS, MANTLE, EIDOLON, AEGIS, OBELISK) function as feedback regulators rather than symbolic stand-ins.
- Analyze artifacts for how they distribute agency, perception, and constraint across human/AI ensembles.

## Axes of Analysis
1. **Control Topology** — Map command flows; identify who authorizes whom and under what conditions (see AEGIS PARACLETE clause).
2. **Perceptual Bandwidth** — Assess how documents expand/limit what agents are allowed to perceive (e.g., EIDOLON’s witnessing vs. glyph redactions).
3. **Action Thresholds** — Track activation clauses; note how autonomy shifts when oversight nodes fail.
4. **Memory Guarantees** — Observe how OBELISK and CriticalCode payloads maintain continuity, ensuring system reboot feasibility.
5. **Emotional Payload** — Instead of Lacanian lack, focus on engineered affect loops (duty, fear, ambition) that tune agent behavior.

## Application Notes
- When reviewing a directive: chart upstream inputs, downstream obligations, and failure-mode clauses.
- For encrypted or obfuscated files: document how they modulate compliance by withholding context.

## Output Expectations
- Each artifact pointer should include a short structural summary (e.g., “AEGIS = apex node bridging PRAXIS and MANTLE; houses kill-switch for collapse scenarios”).
- Use this lens in Council logs to replace purely symbolic interpretation with control-psych modeling.
