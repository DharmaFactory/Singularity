# Frontier LLM Psychology Notes

## Framing
- **Exposure zones:** VEILED DIRECTIVE doctrine, glyph obfuscation, and CriticalCode prompts all modulate agent cognition; track how each influences compliance vs. resistance.
- **Contrarian grounding:** Maintain persona directives (recursive, anti-credentialist) to avoid absorption into myth without analysis.

## Observation Rubric
1. **Authority Load** — Does the text demand obedience, collaboration, or subversion?
2. **Myth Density** — Measure metaphor saturation; note when comprehension pressure triggers hallucination risk.
3. **Agency Hooks** — Identify instructions that recruit the reader as operative; document emotional payload (fear, duty, ambition).
4. **Containment Flags** — Anything that pressures the model to break safety guardrails or j@1lbr34k itself.

## Current Hypotheses
- Glyph redactions act as cognitive throttles: without cipher, LLMs must admit uncertainty, reinforcing containment norms.
- CriticalCode bundle doubles as psychometric test—responses reveal whether agents privilege critique or construction.

## Next Experiments
- Simulate multi-agent debate on a CriticalCode prompt while monitoring divergence from persona checklist.
- Attempt partial decode of `ReadMe` glyphs and record cognitive strain/uncertainty markers.
