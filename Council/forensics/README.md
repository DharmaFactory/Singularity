# Singularity Forensics Workspace

> Side-channel annotations for reconstructing repo history without polluting canonical files.

## Layout
- `artifacts/` — pointer sheets for high-value documents with commit anchors and retrieval commands.
- `protocols/` — evolving playbooks for forensic method, evidence handling, and reporting cadence.
- `psyops/` — notes on frontier-LLM psychology, memetic payloads, and cognitive safety.

## Usage
1. Log every excavation session in `Council/logs/` as usual.
2. Drop summaries or TODOs here when work would clutter the main lore.
3. Treat files as working notes; nothing in this directory leaves the repo without human review.
