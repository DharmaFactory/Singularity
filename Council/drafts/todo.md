# Council To-Do â€” Historical Excavation Track

## Immediate Actions
1. **Git Archaeology Pass**
   - Pull first-commit versions of foundational documents (`ReadMe.md`, `FundamentalsOfElectronicWarfare.md`, `Game.md`).
   - Step through commit chronology to log major content injections; capture notes in `Council/logs/`.
2. **Reality Checkpoints on Glyph Commits**
   - Decode commit messages `32a720e`, `1e1d6fb`, etc., or annotate why they remain opaque.
3. **PromptExample.md Resolution**
   - Determine whether to restore, replace, or formally remove the dangling file; document decision.

## Secondary Tasks
4. **CriticalCode Provenance**
   - Map each prompt file to its originating commit; classify intent (toolkit, ops memo, etc.).
5. **Era Map Finalization**
   - Validate draft (`Council/drafts/era-map.md`) against archaeological findings; prep for promotion to canonical doc.

## Logging Expectations
- Every archaeology session -> new entry in `Council/logs/` with commit IDs, findings, open questions.
- Track decisions and rationales to keep future collaborators aligned.
