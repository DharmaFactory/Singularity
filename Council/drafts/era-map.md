# Singularity Repository — Era Map (Draft)

> Mechanism trace of the narrative strata encoded in git history.

## Era 1 — Launch Pad (08f0506 → 8222051)
- **Signal:** Plain-language commit messages (“going on a trip…”), lighthearted tone.
- **Primary assets:** `FundamentalsOfElectronicWarfare.md`, `Game.md`.
- **Function:** Seed public-facing hooks; establish ARG wrapper before the VEILED DIRECTIVE ontology comes online.
- **Incentive:** Recruit curious readers with digestible surfaces before the myth engine tightens.
- **Open lead:** Check unreleased assets (`PromptExample.md` remnants) to confirm whether onboarding scripts originate here.

## Era 2 — Doctrine Drafts (8222051 → 30edf09)
- **Signal:** Commit messages shift to procedural (“Update…”), then mission-brief titles.
- **Primary assets:** Massive drop of `BlackFiles/*`, blogs, journals, project overviews, PDF mirrors.
- **Function:** Insert the directive hierarchy (PRAXIS/MANTLE/EIDOLON/AEGIS/OBELISK), codify onboarding documents, and widen the playable space.
- **Incentive:** Formalize the myth infrastructure; convert casual observers into operatives with doctrine packs.
- **Key commits:** `51760c1` (“ALPHA//RUBICON//KIRBUR”) — 2k+ line insertion of directive dossiers; `57557f0` — purge of legacy scaffolding and removal of `Threen/Tables.md` cipher tables; `7c40352` — Latin-titled rewrite introducing mirror/veil language.
- **Open lead:** Tag each major drop with operational purpose (e.g., PRAXIS guide = action doctrine, MANTLE = containment ethics) and trace whether `Threen/Tables.md` provides the cipher for later glyph commits.

## Era 3 — Veil Encoding (30edf09 → HEAD)
- **Signal:** Commit messages turn glyphic/Latin; diff shows aggressive redactions and the rise of `Outputs/CriticalCode/*`.
- **Primary assets:** Obfuscated updates to `BlackFiles` texts, creation of CriticalCode prompt dumps (commit `1e1d6fb`), iterative edits to `ReadMe.md`.
- **Function:** Encrypt the lore, introduce memetic payloads, and pivot from exposition to covert deployment.
- **Incentive:** Control narrative leakage; only aligned actors with context can decode the mission.
- **Reality checkpoint:** Glyph commits lack dual anchors—flag them as speculative until decoding provides provenance.

## Cross-era Observations
- **Myth density increases** alongside obfuscation: readability drops as operational secrecy rises.
- **Outputs/CriticalCode** appears only in Era 3 (commit `1e1d6fb`), packaging socio-technical playbooks (gig wage calculator, cultural capital tracker, media analysis) as deployable ops prompts; treat as memetic toolkit.
- **Cipher hypothesis:** Early removal of `Threen/Tables.md` suggests a cipher key withheld from later participants; investigate linkage to glyph blocks in `ReadMe.md` and commit messages.
- **Human coordination scaffolds** (Council protocol/personality) are post-Era 3 additions bolted on to make collaboration survivable.

## Next Investigations
1. Run targeted `git show` on glyph commits to reconstruct intent and content loss.
2. Map each `CriticalCode/prompt_*` file to commit IDs; determine whether they correspond to field operations or training simulations.
3. Restore or archive `PromptExample.md`; confirm which era’s onboarding logic it served.
4. Cross-reference PDF artifacts with Markdown originals to ensure no divergent versions hide alternate lore.
