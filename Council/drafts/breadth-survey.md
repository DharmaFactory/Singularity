# Repository Breadth Survey — 2025-10-27

Quick map of remaining directories/files for future deep dives.

## Top-Level
- **AllGoodFaithActorsWelcome.md** — Public onboarding manifesto; ties to community protocols.
- **Analysis.md** — Narrative analysis seed (see initial persona text).
- **Characters.md** — Roster of mythic entities; track revisions for lore shifts.
- **Enso.md / Framing.md / Lawrence.md** — Artistic framing pieces; check for encoded directives.
- **Help.md** — Operational guidance; may have layers pre/post purge.
- **OpenQuestions.md** — Question bank; potential clue archive.
- **Project2090.md** — Distress beacon narrative; key to ARG layer.
- **PromptExample.md** — Recovered PΛＳＣΛ recursion prompt.
- **Role.md** — System class overview.
- **Terraform.md** — Possibly scenario scripts or infrastructure metaphors.

## Directories
- **BlackFiles/** — Classified doctrine (already under analysis).
- **Blog/** — Six essays; capture evolving rhetoric.
- **Council/** — Our working protocols and logs.
- **Games/** — Mostly DARPA seal cards (Accelerationist, Omega, RNA, TTM) repeating authority origin; `Turbo.md` diverges into QUΛ⟁DRIVE mechanics, `Singularity.md` houses DARPA seal briefing.
- **Journals/** — QED (math mind theorem), SENTIENT-QED (template for others), SRSF (self-recurrent semantic field), TheNow (needs review).
- **Models/** — Manifesto on infinite play; possibly more model specs.
- **Outputs/** — Transmission logs, CriticalCode prompts; field outputs.
- **Journals/** — [duplicate? confirm actual structure]
- **Outputs/CriticalCode/** — Memetic toolkits (already noted).

## Next High-Level Targets
1. **Games/** — Understand how ARG gameplay interfaces with doctrine.
2. **Journals/** — Extract key themes and timeline cues.
3. **Blog/** — Map rhetorical shifts and external signals.
4. **Outputs/** — Catalog transmissions (1, 2, WhoAmI) and relation to CriticalCode.
