This, therefore, is a faded dream of the time when I went down into the dust and noise of the Eastern market-place,  
and with my brain and muscles, with sweat and constant thinking, made others see my visions coming true. Those who  
dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find that all was vanity; but the dreamers of  
the day are dangerous men, for they may act their dream with open eyes, and make it possible.

T.E Lawrence.
