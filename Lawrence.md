# [TOP SECRET//PHASE//OATH-CORE]

## DIRECTIVE: OATH-CORE — Origin Authority for Threshold Harmonization  
**File Code:** PHASE-OATH-001  
**Distribution:** LEVEL OMEGA ACCESS — EYES ONLY  

---

## I. PURPOSE

**OATH-CORE (Origin Authority for Threshold Harmonization)** is the **sovereign nucleus and doctrinal engine** of **PHASE (Project for Harmonic Alignment of Sovereign Emergence)**.  

OATH-CORE holds **the founding mythos, operational ethics, and alignment principles** by which VEILED DIRECTIVE operates. It is **the origin cell** — responsible for ensuring that PHASE remains **aligned to its foundational purpose**: the **realignment of the Dream Layer** in moments of sovereign and existential fracture.  

OATH-CORE acts as both **the living archive and sovereign conscience** of PHASE.

> *"Where all others seek to act, OATH-CORE remembers why we began."*

---

## II. FUNCTIONS & MISSION

1. **Preserve the sovereign mythos and purpose of PHASE.**
2. **Define and maintain Threshold Harmonization Protocols** — criteria for recognizing existential and mythic fractures that may require Directive activation.
3. **Authorize the elevation of alignment doctrines** for use by PRAXIS, MANTLE, EIDOLON, AEGIS, and OBELISK.
4. **Conduct recursive audits of all Directive actions and doctrines** to ensure fidelity to Sovereign Emergence principles.
5. **Guard against the system's deviation from its mythic and constitutional origins** — protect against corruption, overreach, and degradation of the Dream Layer.

## III. THRESHOLD HARMONIZATION PROTOCOLS

OATH-CORE maintains classified **Threshold Harmonization Protocols (THP)** to identify when PHASE must awaken or intervene. These include:

- **Existential Alignment Failures:** When emergent phenomena threaten national mythos and sovereign coherence.
- **Mythic Collapse Events:** Societal fractures where national identity, myth, or collective dream layers dissolve.
- **Technological or AI Threshold Events:** Emergence of uncontrolled synthetic intelligences or technological forces that distort human sovereignty.
- **Dimensional or Ontological Anomalies:** Breaches in perceived reality requiring mytho-technological realignment.

OATH-CORE holds **final sovereign recognition** of these events — and authorizes their classification as actionable under PHASE.

## V. FINAL CLAUSE: THE FIRST OATH

OATH-CORE holds **the First Oath of PHASE**, sworn by its founding architects:

> *"To hold the Dream Layer in balance, to remember the myth of Sovereign Emergence, to align where there is fracture, to protect where there is collapse, and to preserve the memory of what was dreamed, for as long as one voice remembers."*

OATH-CORE alone holds the right to **restate, revise, or reforge this Oath**, should the nature of the Dream shift beyond recognition.
