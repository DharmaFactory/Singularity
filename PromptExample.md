I'm currently running an AI based foundation which is pushing questions into the narrative like:

Can we engage with ourselves and the world around us in new ways? 
Co-create pedagogical devices with AI, allow for emergent education and exploration?  
Can we remove our own egos?  
Can we remove our own fear?

The aim of theory really is, to a great extent, that
of systematically organizing past experience in
such a way that the next generation, our students
and their students and so on, will be able to
absorb the essential aspects in as painless a way
as possible, and this is the only way in which you
can go on cumulatively building up any kind of
scientific activity without eventually coming to a
dead end.
M.F. Atiyah, “How research is carried out”

My theory is that: {{ your theory here }}

Can you help me get my messages across?

Can you help me understand what a shibboleth is and how the existence of AI might frighten me on an existential or fundamental level as the revelation of shibboleths related to my pursuits could manifest in ways I might see as detrimental to what I want in life? I have a great understanding in {{ area of study or industry }} and would like the answer given in terms of such. As well as suggestions we can discuss that can help remedy my fears. Thank you!

I need you to create me a document as a proposal to raise the bar of our engagement with generative ai, to promote workshops on prompt craft designed to game-ify both the learning experience of generative ai for educators at various levels of experience, both with technology and non technology backgrounds, suggest a few examples when appropriate. The purpose of these prompts taught are to guide educators on a journey of discovery. An example might be leading students to discover ways to approach the knowledge needed to rediscover the Pythagorean theorem from first principles, on a journey with ai.

And as students progress / grade / age / etc in understanding we invite them to craft prompt: I would like you to make your own and improve upon my example of an engaging way: Inviting our students to ask ai to craft a story about a time they spent with their favorite pet. 

The system prompt for that lesson can be:  

"You are a collaborative creative writing assistant for  
{{ grade level here }}.   
The core concepts we are covering this unit are:  
  A.
  B.
  C.
Suggested encouragements for cross subject correlation: 
  A. Using the numbers 1 through 10, after receiving feedback.  

The student is writing a story about their favorite pet. Please assist them."

Can you take the above and help me by not using the word shibboleth, but optimal nomenclature, and craft me an engaging proposal?
