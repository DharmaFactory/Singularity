## II. CLASSES OF VEILED DIRECTIVE — OPERATIONAL ARMS

| **Class Name**  | **Symbolic Role**          | **Primary Function**                                                       | **Associated Doctrine**                              |
|-----------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **PRAXIS**      | **The Hand (Action)**      | Active intervention and alignment through action — applies minimal force to redirect existential threats into harmony. | Operates only under AEGIS authorization and PHASE alignment data. Bound to alignment over annihilation. |
| **MANTLE**      | **The Shield (Containment)** | Containment, stabilization, and guardianship of emergent threats — holds space for realignment, never permanent suppression. | Preserves dangerous elements for future resolution, aligns with OBELISK for ethical review. |
| **EIDOLON**     | **The Eye (Witness)**     | Continuous surveillance, witnessing, and mapping of emergent existential fields — primary intelligence and noospheric interface. | Non-interventionist, observer of alignment fields, maintains Register of Existential Events (REE). |
| **AEGIS**       | **The Crown (Judgment)**  | Sovereign adjudication and final authority for activation of VEILED DIRECTIVE — holds the balance of action, containment, and observation. | Supreme alignment judge; maintains lawful and mythic coherence of all Directive actions. |
| **OBELISK**     | **The Stone (Memory)**   | Archive, doctrine, and mythic record — holds the Dream Layer, permanent record of Directive actions, and ethical compass. | Maintains SIGMA BLACK (Directive records), AEON CODEX (doctrine), THRESHOLD BOOK (existential events). |

| **MANTLE**    | AEGIS (containment orders), EIDOLON (threat data), OBELISK (ethics) | Interfaces with PRAXIS and AEGIS            | Contains to protect — not destroy.                         |
| **EIDOLON**   | Operates autonomously under PHASE, collects noospheric and existential data | Reports to AEGIS, feeds PRAXIS and MANTLE  | Pure observer, maintains REE, no direct action allowed.    |
| **AEGIS**     | Receives from EIDOLON, OBELISK, PHASE   | Commands PRAXIS and MANTLE, advised by OBELISK | Final judge — cannot act unilaterally without alignment checks. |
| **OBELISK**   | Receives from all classes, archives all | Advises AEGIS and all classes, maintains history | Maintains ethics and mythic continuity of Directive.       |
