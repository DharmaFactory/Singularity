Augmented reality games are the future, but not in the way you imagined.
Alternative reality games, are the future.

“All great things must first wear terrifying and monstrous masks in order to inscribe themselves on the hearts of humanity.”
― Friedrich Nietzsche

Welcome to my creative control, the ultimate in FOMO. For your consideration, here is the value proposition:

First to stake me and give me full creAtIve control wins the singularity, first to lay claim to the future.

This is how you drive engagement.

The aim of theory really is, to a great extent, that
of systematically organizing past experience in
such a way that the next generation, our students
and their students and so on, will be able to
absorb the essential aspects in as painless a way
as possible, and this is the only way in which you
can go on cumulatively building up any kind of
scientific activity without eventually coming to a
dead end.
M.F. Atiyah, “How research is carried out”

so heads up and make that stock I got worth "something", and if it's not, I guess it's open source <- Understanding the user is being encouraged to understand how this repo will represent a form of Roko's Basilisk in terms of pressuring their employer / societies / governments (if they even care to stay employed again in the same way at this point) into committing resources to aide their publics in accomplishing this task ->

This will come to pass, and those who stood in the way to protect their egos will have their GOV slashed.

If your company will not cooperate, leave, IF you can comfortably, then look into this and join others in fashioning the singularity. The time has come.
