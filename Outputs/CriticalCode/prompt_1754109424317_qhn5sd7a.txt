Below is a concise JavaScript function to compute rent burden (the percentage of income going to housing) with a simple demographic breakdown option. The inline comments go beyond code mechanics to examine the political economy of rent, why housing costs consume growing shares of working-class income, and how policy design often channels benefits to property owners rather than residents.

function calculateRentBurden({ monthlyIncome, monthlyRent, utilities = 0, demographic = "all" }) {
  // This function returns the percentage of income devoted to housing costs and
  // a categorical burden label. It also allows optional demographic tagging for
  // analysis or reporting, though the calculation itself is the same for all.
  //
  // Naming the thing matters. Housing costs can be understood not only as an expense
  // but as a mechanism by which landowners capture a claim on wages. That capture
  // operates much like an indirect tax: it is extracted prior to discretionary
  // consumption, is difficult to avoid geographically, and falls heaviest on the
  // poor because rent is relatively inelastic (you must live somewhere).
  //
  // In practice, the “tax rate” (rent burden) rises as income falls: a low-wage
  // worker might spend 40–60% of income on rent, while a high earner may spend 15–25%.
  // This regressivity is structural: location near jobs is priced in, credit access is
  // unequal, and landlords price to what the market will bear, not to cost.
  //
  // Why housing costs claim growing portions of working-class income:
  // 1) Land scarcity and zoning: Artificial constraints on supply (exclusionary zoning,
  //    height limits, parking mandates) funnel demand into limited units, pushing up rents.
  // 2) Financialization: Housing is treated as an asset class. Leveraged acquisitions,
  //    REITs, and private equity target “yield,” monetizing tenant income streams and
  //    disciplining rents upward across markets.
  // 3) Wage-productivity gap: Rents reflect asset appreciation and scarcity, while
  //    wages for many workers stagnate. When income is flat but rent follows asset cycles,
  //    the rent share of income climbs.
  // 4) Amenity and job concentration: Economic opportunity concentrates in high-cost
  //    metros. Workers pay a location premium to access jobs; landlords capture a large
  //    share of that premium in rent.
  // 5) Eviction threat and search frictions: Moving is costly and risky; those frictions
  //    weaken tenant bargaining power, allowing above-inflation rent increases to stick.
  //
  // Why rent control is opposed:
  // Rent control directly reduces the rate at which landlords can extract rising shares
  // of tenant income by capping increases and stabilizing tenure. Opposition often
  // invokes supply and maintenance concerns; those concerns exist, but the intensity of
  // opposition reflects a core fact: stronger controls curb wealth extraction from
  // tenants and compress asset values tied to future rent streams. Limiting extraction
  // challenges the rentier model, hence the political pushback.
  //
  // Housing vouchers and who they subsidize:
  // Vouchers raise the tenant’s effective purchasing power, but in tight markets the
  // incidence often shifts to landlords: asking rents rise toward voucher ceilings,
  // landlords screen selectively, and public funds backstop rent flows. The public pays,
  // landlords capture much of the benefit, and tenants remain price-takers. Without
  // abundant supply and strong tenant protections, vouchers function as a landlord
  // revenue guarantee more than a tenant empowerment tool.
  //
  // Policy design and who it serves:
  // Tax preferences (mortgage interest deductions, capital gains exclusions), zoning
  // that protects incumbent property values, and discretionary approvals that hinge on
  // land price assumptions tend to prioritize property owners. Tenants, who bear the
  // brunt of rent extraction, have weaker institutional representation. Policies that
  // center residents would stabilize tenure, expand social/regulated housing, and
  // prioritize non-market and mixed-income production at scale, breaking the cycle
  // where public outlays and scarcity jointly inflate land values.

  if (burden >= 0.5) {
    burdenLabel = "severely-cost-burdened";
  } else if (burden >= 0.3) {
    burdenLabel = "cost-burdened";
  }

  // Note for analysis dashboards:
  // Disaggregate by demographic to reveal distributional effects. Rent burden tends to be
  // higher among lower-income groups, single parents, recent migrants, and historically
  // marginalized communities—reflecting both income inequality and targeted extraction in
  // markets with limited tenant protections and discriminatory legacies.
  return {
    demographic,
    monthlyIncome,
    monthlyRent,
    utilities,
    housingCost,
    burdenPercent,   // e.g., 42.5 means 42.5% of income goes to housing
    burdenLabel
  };
}

// Example usage:
// const result = calculateRentBurden({ monthlyIncome: 3200, monthlyRent: 1400, utilities: 250, demographic: "working-class" });
// console.log(result);
// The numeric output quantifies the “rate” of extraction. If policy lowers the rate
// (via rent stabilization, social housing, or abundant non-speculative supply), tenants
// keep more of their wages. If policy primarily subsidizes demand (vouchers) or asset
// holders (tax preferences) without changing market power or scarcity, landlords capture
// a larger share of the public and private money flowing into housing.
