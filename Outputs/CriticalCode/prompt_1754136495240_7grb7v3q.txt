Below is a self-contained Python script that ingests a simple CSV of surveillance-related firms/projects (with columns like company, product, sector, revenue, lobbying_spend, gov_contracts, data_scope, and region), performs basic exploratory analysis, and surfaces relationships that illustrate how surveillance capitalism aligns corporate profit motives with state power. The comments intentionally go beyond code mechanics to unpack how digital surveillance is justified via security rhetoric, how it enables new forms of social control and profit extraction, and why privacy violations are profitable for corporations and useful for state control.

You can adapt the column names and paths to your dataset. If you don’t have data yet, the script can generate a small synthetic dataset to demonstrate the workflow and the political-economic dynamics it reveals.

# NOTE ON FRAMING:
# This script approaches surveillance as a political-economic system that fuses corporate profit extraction
# with state power, rather than a neutral tool for "public safety." While code usually focuses on method,
# here the comments also interrogate purpose: who benefits materially from surveillance expansion, how security
# rhetoric legitimizes it, and how digital tracking normalizes new forms of social control (behavioral prediction,
# exclusion, labor discipline, and the chilling of dissent). The aim is to surface the economic interests behind
# surveillance systems and how those interests shape policy, procurement, and product design.

# EXPECTED CSV SCHEMA (example):
# company,product,sector,revenue,lobbying_spend,gov_contracts,data_scope,region,security_marketing_intensity
# - revenue: annual revenue attributable to surveillance-related products/services (in USD)
# - lobbying_spend: annual lobbying dollars (in USD)
# - gov_contracts: value of government contracts (in USD)
# - data_scope: categorical or numeric indicator of how intrusive/broad data collection is (e.g., "narrow", "broad", "extreme" or a 1-5 score)
# - security_marketing_intensity: proxy metric (0-1) for how strongly security rhetoric is emphasized in marketing/public communications
#
# NOTE: These variables let us examine how privacy-invasive “data scope” tracks with revenue growth,
# how lobbying correlates with profitable contracts, and how “security” messaging intensity aligns with
# both intrusion and sales. This operationalizes the claim that surveillance capitalism profits from
# privacy violations and that state alignment (contracts, subsidies, legal carve-outs) is a key channel
# of value creation. It also foregrounds how security rhetoric functions as a marketing-political technology.

    # Closing analysis:
    # 1) How surveillance capitalism creates new social control:
    #    By commodifying behavioral data at scale, firms produce predictive and classificatory systems that
    #    discipline populations (credit/insurance pricing, worker productivity tracking, automated eligibility,
    #    protest monitoring). These systems convert social life into inputs for managerial control and monetization,
    #    narrowing autonomy and chilling dissent.
    #
    # 2) Why privacy violations are profitable and useful for state control:
    #    More granular, cross-context data boosts prediction accuracy, ad performance, and risk scoring—core revenue sources.
    #    The same data makes populations legible to the state, facilitating surveillance, border control, and policing.
    #    Corporations monetize; states gain visibility. Legal exemptions and public contracts align their incentives.
    #
    # 3) Security rhetoric as justification:
    #    “Safety,” “national security,” and “resilience” narratives legitimize intrusive systems, deflect scrutiny,
    #    and shift debate from rights and power to fear and urgency. This narrative machinery is visible in the
    #    positive association between security-marketing intensity, broader data scope, and sales/contracts.
    #
    # 4) Digital surveillance enables unprecedented control:
    #    Always-on sensors, identity resolution, and cross-device data fusion enable continuous tracking and algorithmic
    #    intervention. The infrastructure outlives specific crises, normalizing routine monitoring. Economic incentives
    #    favor expansion, not restraint—especially where lobbying converts public budgets into private revenue.
    #
    # In short: Surveillance systems, marketed as safety tools, operate as profit engines and governance technologies.
    # Their growth reflects capital accumulation and state administrative interests more than demonstrated public safety gains.
