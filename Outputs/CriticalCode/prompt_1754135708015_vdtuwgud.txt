Below is a simple, data-oriented function you can adapt for a “crisis capitalism tracker.” It ingests datasets of crises and policy changes, computes correlations and temporal alignments, and flags patterns that suggest “shock doctrine” dynamics (i.e., when crises precede or coincide with policies that disproportionately benefit elite interests). The inline comments go beyond code mechanics to critically examine how crisis narratives can enable unpopular policies, how emergency measures become entrenched, and how wealth is transferred from public to private hands.

Note: This is a scaffold; you’ll need to tailor feature engineering to your jurisdiction(s), data availability, and the kinds of “elite-benefit” policy markers you want to score.

    Commentary:
    Crises typically come with strong narrative frames emphasizing urgency, uncertainty,
    and necessity. These frames are not neutral descriptors; they shape the "Overton window"
    of permissible policy. The presence of keywords like 'emergency' is not merely text;
    it signals a governance pivot: the justification switch from deliberative consent
    to expedited compliance. This is central to how unpopular policies can be routed
    through narrow procedural channels during periods of public fear and informational overload.

    - stickiness_risk: ex ante risk (0-1) that the measure persists beyond crisis (based on design: auto-renewals,
      vague criteria for termination, institutionalization in baseline budgets, creation of vested contractor lobbies).
    Commentary:
    Policy attributes operationalize the political economy thesis:
    1) Unpopular policies often pass under 'emergency' packaging (high democratic_bypass_score).
    2) 'Temporary' measures harden into permanent infrastructure when sunset clauses are weak and when new
       beneficiaries acquire lobbying power (stickiness_risk).
    3) The distribution of benefits ('beneficiaries_score') makes visible the transfer mechanism—public guarantees,
       tax preferences, monopoly rights, or privatized revenue streams replacing public services.

    Correlate crises with policy changes likely to reflect crisis-justified, elite-benefiting measures.

    Inputs:
    - window_days: time window around a crisis within which policies are considered associated.
    - weights: control the composite 'shock_doctrine_index' which synthesizes severity, elite benefit,
      democratic bypass, and permanence risk—mirroring how 'temporary emergencies' become durable policy baselines.

    Commentary on logic:
    1) Temporal proximity: Policies passed during or shortly after crises deserve scrutiny because urgency messaging
       compresses deliberation and allows omnibus bills to carry riders that would fail in calmer times.
    2) Elite-benefit filter: We focus on policies with high beneficiaries_score because crisis framing often
       rationalizes asymmetric interventions (e.g., asset guarantees, regulatory waivers) as necessary for stability.
    3) Bypass and permanence: High democratic_bypass_score flags process shortcuts; high stickiness_risk flags the
       institutional cement that converts a momentary exception into ongoing architecture—budgets, contracts,
       surveillance systems, or privatized revenue models that persist after fear subsides.
    4) Narrative alignment: Overlap in narrative_tags between crisis and policy can indicate deliberate coupling:
       the same 'emergency' lexicon used to justify both the crisis response and the policy wish list, which
       otherwise would face public pushback.

    Why emergency measures become permanent:
    - Political economy inertia: beneficiaries mobilize to defend rents; opponents face collective action problems.
    - Institutional embedding: new agencies, IT systems, or legal capabilities create sunk costs and path dependence.
    - Moving baselines: renewals become default; sunset criteria are vague or tied to unfalsifiable conditions.
    - Risk aversion: officials prefer not to be blamed for rollback if another shock occurs (“one-way ratchet”).

    How crisis narratives bypass deliberation:
    - Agenda control: elites pack long-desired measures into emergency packages.
    - Temporal scarcity: accelerated timelines limit hearings, amendments, and public scrutiny.
    - Framing effects: dissent is cast as irresponsible or dangerous amid uncertainty, shrinking the space for
      democratic contestation about structural redistribution or market governance.

How to use:
1) Build datasets:
   - crises: crises with severity indices, dates, and narrative tags derived from media/official communications.
   - policies: policy changes with scores. You can score beneficiaries using distributional tax analyses, sectoral event studies, contract concentration indices, or regulatory cost-benefit allocations; bypass via legislative process metadata; stickiness via sunset design and institutionalization features.

2) Call correlate_crises_with_policies(crises, policies, window_days=365, ...).

3) Inspect results and rationales. Higher shock_doctrine_index values indicate stronger patterns consistent with crisis-enabled passage of elite-benefiting, durable policies.

Analytical discussion (non-code):
- How crises justify unpopular policies:
  Crises heighten perceived risk and uncertainty, lowering tolerance for delay. Political entrepreneurs bundle preexisting agendas into “must-pass” packages, framing them as necessary for stability. The public’s bandwidth to parse distributional consequences is limited under stress, enabling measures like broad liability shields, regressive tax accelerations, or deregulatory riders that would face opposition in normal times.

- Why “temporary” emergency measures persist:
  They create beneficiaries (contractors, surveillance vendors, financial institutions) who organize to defend rents; agencies build workflows and systems around the new powers; renewals become default via automatic triggers; and policymakers fear being blamed for rolling back protections if another shock occurs. The result is a one-way ratchet: new exceptions become the new baseline.

- How shock doctrine transfers public wealth to private hands:
  Mechanisms include socializing losses while privatizing gains (guarantees, backstops, preferential lending), converting public services into private concessions with guaranteed revenue, granting monopoly/oligopoly rights under expedited procurement, and rewriting tax and regulatory codes to concentrate benefits. Funding and legal risk are borne by the public; upside accrues to well-positioned firms and asset holders.

- How crisis narratives bypass democratic deliberation:
  Emergency frames justify fast-track procedures, limit debate, and conflate dissent with irresponsibility. Complex omnibus bills obscure distributive riders. Time compression curtails stakeholder input and judicial review. This procedural narrowing is not incidental; it’s functional to advancing structurally significant economic changes with minimal accountability.

Extensions and cautions:
- Add causal inference modules (difference-in-differences, event studies) to move beyond correlation.
- Track heterogeneity: which sectors, which agencies, which legislative vehicles?
- Maintain an audit trail of scoring decisions; perform sensitivity analysis on weights to avoid encoding bias.
- Incorporate sunset tracking and actual repeal/expiry outcomes to validate stickiness predictions over time.
